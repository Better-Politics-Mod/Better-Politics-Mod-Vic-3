The Shogun has been reluctant to do so, but the missive is a clear sign that the Dutch are willing to support the Shogun in his efforts to modernize Japan. The Shogun must now decide whether to accept the Dutch offer or to continue to resist foreign influence."
 bpm_boshin_events.1.f: "”Your honourable majesty must already know from the missives you receive of the port of Nagasaki that her Majesty the Queen of England has sent troops to China. To carefully protect now the interests of the people under your rule it is of the greatest prudence that you open the ports of Japan to foreign trade. If your majesty does not befriend a thousand other nations it will doubtlessly make a thousand enemies.” ー Willem II"
