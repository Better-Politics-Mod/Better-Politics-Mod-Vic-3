The goal of BPM is to make politics more dynamic, more legible, more historically relevant. It sets out to correct these problems I have with the base game:
[olist]
[*]Seven interest groups are not nearly sufficient to represent the breadth of political history. 
[*]An IG's ideology is overdetermined by the random ideology of its leader. For instance, trade unions can swing from communist to reactionary overnight, which doesn't make sense.
[*]All IGs are internally united, when many of them suffered infighting and splits IRL. Why should all urban workers become communist at the same time? Where did the moderates go?
[*]Political parties are shallow. They're too arbitrary, form and dissipate too frequently. Coalitions are either small and boring or huge and illegitimate.
[*]There is little international interaction between IGs, when many of them communicated and collaborated.
[/olist]
For more information about the design philosophy of BPM, you can [url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BbYkT7m-ATQfFKUv01adwyg9t3McDWgkP7DppNRRe3I/edit?usp=sharing]read our design doc here[/url].

[h3]Compatibility:[/h3]
For all mods listed below, [b]make sure BPM is placed last in the load order[/b].
[list]
[*][b]Victorian Tweaks Mod[/b] (VTM): Compatible. May have weird balancing.
[*][b]Ultra Historical[/b] (UH): Politics mod is incompatible. Research and Education requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3119667295&searchtext=Better+Politics+Mod+compatibility]this compatch[/url]. All others are compatible.
[*][b]Victorian Flavor Mod[/b] (VFM): Possibly compatible.
[*][b]The Great Rework[/b] (TGR): Incompatible, but integration is coming.
[*]Otherwise, BPM should be compatible with most mods that do not add new laws, ideologies, or institutions.
[*]Mods that add new pop types and IGs should work, but no guarantees that they interact with BPM in ways that make sense.
