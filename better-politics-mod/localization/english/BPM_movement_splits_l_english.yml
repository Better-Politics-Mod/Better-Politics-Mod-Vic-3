# Liberal split
  bpm_movement_splits.1.t: "The Rise of Liberalism"
  bpm_movement_splits.1.d: "Intellectuals and bourgeoisie alike have been drawn to a growing liberal movement in our nation. Espousing reforms that push for constitutional governance and protection of property rights. Liberal thinkers have now organized and have begun to exert direct pressure on our government."
  bpm_movement_splits.1.f: "Morals are in all countries the result of legislation and government; they are not African or Asian or European: they are good or bad\n—Denis Diderot, 1774"

# Conservative Split
  bpm_movement_splits.2.t: "The March to Modernity"
  bpm_movement_splits.2.d: "As reformism continues to develop in our nation more and more prominent leaders and thinkers have become seriously interested in developing modern political and economic institutions. The reformist movement can now be divided into two camps: the conservatives and the liberals. The former are more cautious, looking to modernize the state while maintaining a careful oligarchy bolstered by traditional institutions while making concessions to the rising bourgeoisie, while the latter are focused on meritocratic reforms, formalization of constitutionalism, and the empowering of early democratic institutions."
  bpm_movement_splits.2.f: "The outward circumstances of national wealth and power are not irrevocably fixed by nature's decree. They can be changed by the diligent efforts of men. Today's fools can become tomorrow's sages. The rich and mighty of the past can become the poor and weak today...If we begin to pursue learning with spirit and energy, so as to achieve personal independence and thereby enrich and strengthen the nation, why should we fear the powers of the west?\n -Fukuzawa Yukichi, 1872"

# Radical Split
  bpm_movement_splits.3.t: "The Radicals"
  bpm_movement_splits.3.d: "A growing faction of liberals in our nation have gained national attention. These radical liberals call for a massive overhaul of the state in favor of egalitarianism and free expression. They diverge from more moderate liberals in their desire to crush traditional institutions (including monarchies) with revolutionary fervor."
  bpm_movement_splits.3.f: "Tremble all ye oppressors of the world! Take warning all ye supporters of slavish governments, and slavish hierarchies! Call no more (absurdly and wickedly) reformation, innovation. You cannot now hold the world in darkness. Struggle no longer against increasing light and liberality. Restore to mankind their rights; and consent to the correction of abuses, before they and you are destroyed together.\n —Richard Price, 1789"

# Absolutist Split
  bpm_movement_splits.4.t: "The Absolutists"
  bpm_movement_splits.4.d: "A growing number of influential figures in our realm have adopted a philosophy of centralization under the [GetPlayer.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] under the auspices that they derive their right to rule from heaven itself and that the sovereignty of the state is derived from this truth. "
  bpm_movement_splits.4.f: "The King resembles a gardener, who plucks up the thorns and briers and throws them on one side, whereby he beautifies his garden, and at the same time raises a fence which preserves his ground from the intrusion of strangers. The King detaches from the nobles their too numerous friends and dangerous dependents. In affairs of moment it is not advisable to consult with many.\n —Abul Fazl, 1590"

# Agpop Split
  bpm_movement_splits.5.t: "The Rise of Agrarian Populism"
  bpm_movement_splits.5.d: "The rising ideologies of an ever changing and modernizing world have inspired many rural leaders, applying these concepts to critique the power structures of the countryside. These Agrarian Populists hold a wide array of at times idiosyncratic beliefs shaped by their cultures and material conditions, but all hold a deep conviction for land reform and returning power to the people who work in the farms and villages of our nation."
  bpm_movement_splits.5.f: "The Tsar is in a state of permanent indecision, and has lost the power of all real thought: he wants emancipation, and yet does all he can to prevent it. He has come to see that the emancipation of the peasant is tantamount to the emancipation of the land: and that the emancipation of the land would in turn usher in a social revolution and would make rural communism sacrosanct... What a blessing it is for Russia that the rural commune has never been broken up, that private ownership has never replaced the property of the commune.\n —Aleksandr Herzen, 1851"

# Socialist Split
  bpm_movement_splits.6.t: "The Socialists"
  bpm_movement_splits.6.d: "Across our nation an egalitarian movement is growing. Driven by the stark inequality evident in our growing cities, the socialist movement seeks to democratize society from the ground up. The socialists are diverse in their strategies, from founding independent communes, to sweeping reformism, to organizing popular resistance and revolution. The socialist movement is young, but it has already become a specter that haunts the powerful and emboldens the common man."
  bpm_movement_splits.6.f: "There is a tyranny, I know, far more difficult to elude or shake than that of a Nero or a Tiberius; it is the tyranny of circumstances. It is born of a corrupted social order; it is composed of ignorance, poverty, neglect, bad example, mental sufferings...in the present state of things it is thought perfectly clear and intelligible, that everyone is free to ruin himself, in order to ruin another!\n—Louis Blanc, 1839"

# Market Liberal Split
  bpm_movement_splits.7.t: "The Market Liberals"
  bpm_movement_splits.7.d: "As the debate between protectionism and free trade rages on, a contingent of liberals have doubled down on free trade and laissez-faire economic policy, seeing the freeing of markets as the most surefire way to build a prosperous and just economy. They place trust in private actors to manage resources in s fluctuating market, rapidly adjusting to the shifts in supply and demand on the global market."
  bpm_movement_splits.7.f: "The aim of protection, in short, is to prevent the bringing into a country of things in themselves useful and valuable, in order to compel the making of such things. But what all mankind in the individual affairs of every-day life, regard as to be desired is not the making of things, but the possession of things.\n -Henry George, 1896"

# National Liberal Split 
  bpm_movement_splits.8.t: "The National Liberals"
  bpm_movement_splits.8.d: "As the 19th century has marched on, the concept of liberal nationalism has grown and matured, shaped by both successes and failures. In many contemporary nation states, including ours, it has evolved into a deeply romantic movement, with those swept up in it seeking to develop a strong and modern national identity. Contemporary nationalism influences governance and culture alike, and the national liberals at the forefront of this movement make themselves known as a force in their own right."
  bpm_movement_splits.8.f: "Whatever that past generation of statesmen, law-givers and writers was capable of, we know. What they attained, what they failed to attain, we also know. Our duty and our destiny is another from theirs. Liking not at all its borrowed sound, we are yet ... a new generation; and it is for us now to inquire, what we may have it in our power to accomplish, and on what objects the world may reasonably ask that we should fix our regards.\n -Cornelius Mathews, 1845"

# Anarchist Split
  bpm_movement_splits.9.t: "The Anarchists"
  bpm_movement_splits.9.d: "As the socialist thought grows and develops, the internal debates within the movement gain their own character and their own fractions. This time, the new fraction is that of the Anarchists; those of socialist creed who believe that the state, with its coercive might is just as big of a threat as the bourgeoisie are to the well-being of mankind, demanding abolition of both, as simultaneously as possible."
  bpm_movement_splits.9.f: "“Anarchists have said it thousands of times, and the whole of history bears out what they say: private property and political power are the two links in the chain that binds humanity and like the twin edges of an assassin’s blade. There is no way of breaking free of the one without breaking free of the other. Abolish private property without abolishing government, and the former will be resurrected by those who govern. Abolish government without abolishing private property, and the property owners will resurrect government.”\n—Errico Malatesta, 1897"

# Refsoc Split
  bpm_movement_splits.11.t: "The Reformist Cause"
  bpm_movement_splits.11.d: "Just as the appeal of the socialist cause continues to widen, so too do debates about its future. Recent electoral successes for the proletariat have pathed the way for a new faction of socialists – the Reformists. This newly emergent Reformist wing advocates for gradual and peaceful reform over needless bloodshed, while staying true to the ultimate goal of achieving socialism."
  bpm_movement_splits.11.f: "“A class which is aspiring needs a sound morale and must suffer no deterioration. Whether it sets out for itself an ideal ultimate aim is of secondary importance if it pursues with energy its proximate aims. The important point is that these aims are inspired by a definite principle which expresses a higher degree of economy and of social life, that they are an embodiment of a social conception which means in the evolution of civilisation a higher view of morals and of legal rights.”\n—Eduard Bernstein, 1899"
