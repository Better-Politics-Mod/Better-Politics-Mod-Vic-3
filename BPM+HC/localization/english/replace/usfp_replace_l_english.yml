je_acw_countdown:0 "A House Divided"
je_acw_countdown_reason:0 "The issue of slavery has divided the North and South of the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] since before the drafting of the Declaration of Independence. Then as now, a series of compromises in the Federal government have forestalled open conflict. As the [SCOPE.sIdeology('abolitionist_scope').GetName] cause continues to grow in the North, the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('landowners_scope').GetName] have continued to demand more concessions and compromises to protect their 'peculiar institution' from interference.\n\nOne way or another, the Union cannot endure half slave and half free for much longer."

This proposal is unacceptable to the [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('planters_scope').GetName], but they have put forth few alternatives."
 acw_events.3.f:0 ""I plead the cause of the rights of white freemen. I would preserve for free white labor a fair country, a rich inheritance, where the sons of toil, of my own race and own color, can live without the disgrace which association with negro slavery brings upon free labor.""

 je_indian_removal:1 "Indian Removal"
 je_indian_removal_reason:2 "The Five Civilized Tribes have long lived in the American south, and have been the target of 'civilizing' missions since the days of independence. In recent decades, [SCOPE.sCulture('yankee_culture').GetName] and [SCOPE.sCulture('dixie_culture').GetName] settlers have increasingly encroached on the lands of the Five Tribes, sparking violent conflicts.\n\nThe Jackson administration chose to support the incoming settlers, and resolved to see all natives removed to the [SCOPE.sCountry('indian_territory_scope').GetName], regardless of the cost."

His petition has almost as many signatures as the entire eastern Cherokee population."
 native_resettlement.2.f:0 ""By the stipulations of this treaty, we are stripped of every attribute of freedom. Our property may be plundered before our eyes; violence may be committed on our persons, even our lives may be taken away, and there is none to regard our complaints. We are denationalized; we are disfranchised. We are deprived of membership in the human family!""
 native_resettlement.2.a:0 "A treaty is a treaty. We cannot rescind what we have signed."
 native_resettlement.2.b:0 "Our conscience compels us to void the removal treaty."

native_resettlement.3.t: "Cherokee Removal"
 native_resettlement.3.d:1 "In accordance with the removal treaty, it is time for the [SCOPE.sCulture('cherokee_culture').GetName] of [SCOPE.sState('indian_removal_state').GetStateRegion.GetName] to relocate to the [SCOPE.sCountry('indian_territory_scope').GetName]. Some holdouts refuse to leave their homes, and many are poorly equipped for the journey."

 native_resettlement.4.t:0 "The Trail of Tears"
 native_resettlement.4.d:1 "Our efforts to remove the [SCOPE.sCulture('cherokee_culture').GetName] from eastern lands has led to the deaths of many during their overland march westward."
 native_resettlement.4.f:0 ""In the dark the tall pines moan\nAs they guard the dismal trail.\nThe Cherokees say it is the groan,\nEvery shriek and echoed groan\nOf their forefathers that fell\nWith broken hopes and bitter fears\nOn that weary trail of tears."" # Ruth Margaret Muskrat

 native_resettlement.5.f:0 "A pair of Europeans watched the Americans go. In the whole scene there was an air of ruin and destruction, something which betrayed a final and irrevocable adieu. One of the observers asked a passing man:\n\n"Why are you leaving your country?"\n\nThe American, sombre and taciturn, replied simply:\n\n"To be free."\n\nBefore the White men could inquire more, the American walked on, continuing his journey east. The Frenchman turned to his compatriot:\n\n"We watch the expulsion, the dissolution, of one of the most celebrated and ancient American peoples.""

 acw_followup_events.5.f:0 ""The rioters stomped, kicked, and clubbed others mercilessly. The streets grew slick with the blood of innocent men. Emptied revolvers clattered on the ground as attacks grew too frenzied to bother with reloading anymore. It was only when martial law was declared and troops marched in that even a pretense of order could return.""

 acw_followup_events.6.d:0 "A coalition of Confederate sympathizers have won control of [SCOPE.sState('redeemer_state').GetName]'s state government through means fair and foul, and begun to implement a raft of restrictions on [SCOPE.sCulture('afro_american_culture').GetName] activities."
 acw_followup_events.6.f:0 ""Draw a line one side of which you see intelligence, virtue, self-respect, and democracy; and on the other the absolute unchecked political supremacy of brute force and terror, and there you will behold not one attribute of free government, but the saddest tyranny of the Old South desperately clawing back power that ever cursed this earth."" # this is an inversion of Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar II's horrible racist diatribe.
 acw_followup_events.6.a:0 "We must respect the election results."

We must now attempt to reintegrate the rebellious states into the Union, while also incorporating the liberated slaves into our society.\n\nThe #bold Progress Bar#! tracks the status of Reconstruction. Advancing Reconstruction will uphold our promise to the #bold Freedmen#! and ensure their rights and liberties. Unfortunately, the White #bold Redeemers#! of the South will not accept anything even approaching racial equality, and will actively fight to reverse Reconstruction.\n\nWe must choose which is more important to us: the rights and lives of our [SCOPE.sCulture('afro_american_culture').GetName] citizens, or a swift reconciliation with the [SCOPE.sCulture('dixie_culture').GetName] states."
