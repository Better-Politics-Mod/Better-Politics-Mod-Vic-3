 bpm_natlib_split.1.d:0 "As the nationalism of radicals fades into memory, a new brand of nationalism has arisen to take its place. Across Germany, capitalists and workers alike flock to the banner of the  @ig_national_liberals! #yellow National Liberals#!. They promise civil liberties, a strong state, a secure livelihood, and above all a united Germany built upon the great tradition of German idealism."
 bpm_natlib_split.1.f:0 "An act which emanates from the political authority is a universal act, and by virtue of its true universality, it also bears the rule of its application within itself. What it refers to is universal and identical with itself. The act of the political authority imparts a free and universal determinacy, and its execution is at the same time its application. Since no distinctions can be made in what it applies to, its application must be defined in the act itself, and no refractory or disparate material offers resistance in its application. \n\n—G.W.F. Hegel, 1802"

Across our country, capitalists and workers alike now flock to the banner of the  @ig_national_liberals! #yellow National Liberals#!. They promise a strong state backed by the people, a secure livelihood provided for the people, and above all a united nation to stand proud on the world stage."

Across our country, capitalists and workers alike now flock to the banner of the  @ig_national_liberals! #yellow National Liberals#!. They promise a strong state backed by the people, a secure livelihood provided for the people, and a modern nation to stand proud on the world stage."
 bpm_natlib_split.3.f:0 "Some men who are not real men love other things about themselves, but the real man believes that his honor is dearer than his life; and a nation is merely all of us put together, and the nation's honor is dearer than the nation's comfort and the nation's peace and the nation's life itself. \n\n—Woodrow Wilson, 1916"

 bpm_natlib_split.4.t:0 "The Return of Bonapartism"
 bpm_natlib_split.4.d:0 "As old Napoleon rests in his tomb, his heirs claw their way back into the world of the living. There, they discover an ancient, crumbling Paris, surrounded by a divided country, infested with poverty and despair. Disappointed, they look to their leader — #blue Louis Napoleon Bonaparte#!, two coups under his belt and gilded with the glory that had so inspired a generation of Frenchmen prior.\n\nThough today they find themselves ridiculed by the gentlemen of high society, soon the people will decide if they prefer the strong hand of a Bonaparte after all."
 bpm_natlib_split.4.f:0 "Hegel remarks somewhere that all great world-historical facts and personages appear, so to speak, twice. He forgot to add: the first time as tragedy, the second time as farce. \n\n—Karl Marx, 1852"

 bpm_natlib_split.5.t:0 "Positivists"
 bpm_natlib_split.5.d:0 "As the nationalism of radicals fades into memory, a new brand of nationalism has arisen to take its place. Across our country, industrialists and workers alike now flock to the banner of @ig_national_liberals!Positivism, which promises a strong state backed by the people, a secure livelihood provided for the people, and a modernized nation to stand on the world stage."
 bpm_natlib_split.5.f:0 "The first condition of unity is a subjective principle; and this principle in the Positive system is the subordination of the intellect to the heart: Without this the unity that we seek can never be placed on a permanent basis, whether individually or collectively. It is essential to have some influence sufficiently powerful to produce convergence amid the heterogeneous and often antagonistic tendencies of so complex an organism as ours. \n\n—Auguste Comte, 1844"
 bpm_natlib_split.5.a:0 "Love, Order, and Progress!"

 bpm_fascist_split.1.t:0 "Fascists"
 bpm_fascist_split.1.d:0 "A new force of reaction arises, the @ig_fascists!Fascists. An ultranationalist movement, they advocate for a state ordered on class collaboration and unyielding loyalty to the nation."
 bpm_fascist_split.1.f:0 "The masses have a right to change property relations; Fascism seeks to give them an expression while preserving property. The logical result of Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life. The violation of the masses, whom Fascism, with its Führer cult, forces to their knees, has its counterpart in the violation of an apparatus which is pressed into the production of ritual values. \n\n—Walter Benjamin, 1936"
