 bpm_christdem_split.30.f: "The political democratization of our lives must be complemented by economic and social democratization.\n\n(...)\n\nLiberal-capitalist policy has proved fatal, especially in its social effects. It harms the basis of a healthy social order, having as its main goal only the greatest possible personal profit for the entrepreneur and capitalist, with no regard for the principle of justice, human dignity and the common good.\n\n— Labor Party (Stronnictwo Pracy) Program, 1937" # Enterprises of great importance for the economic life of the Nation or its defense, and large joint-stock enterprises and their complexes, where the initiative and management of the owner do not play a major role gradually as the appropriate conditions mature, will pass into the ownership of the state, local governments or social associations. Medium-sized and small enterprises should be made more accessible to private ownership, and the development of Poland's handicrafts should also be given considerable support.
