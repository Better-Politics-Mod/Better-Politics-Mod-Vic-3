The forcing open of our ports has led to the collapse of our banking system and the flooding of our ports with foreigners, including missionaries. Many Daimyos and members of the imperial house are beginning to believe radical change is needed to secure Japan from foreign domination.\n\nSome are calling this the #v Bakumatsu#!, the end of the Shogunate.\n\nProgress towards the end of the shogunate is made on a monthly basis by #P 1#! each month. Events may also occur that allow for jumps in progress towards a restoration."

 je_bpm_secure_shogunate_reason:0 "The Tokugawa clan has lead Japan as shoguns since the 17th century, establishing a time of order and isolation off the heels of the warring states period. However, not all power in Japan lies in the palm of the Shogun and his clan, regional Daimyo lords privately control vast swaths of the country and command legions of men at arms and Samurai. This careful balance of policy has been shattered by European intervention and the imposition of treaties bringing and end to Sakoku isolation.\n\nTo preserve the Tokugawa shogunate and rebuke the restorationists certain careful reforms must be taken to secure power before the Tokugawa clan loses its credibility and grasp on power."

Here, endogenous means emerging naturally from within, like a bud blooms into a flower in an outward motion, and exogenous means being forced to take a certain form because of external influences..."\n—Soseki Natsume, 1911#!\n\nJapan has for cenuries been an isolated economy, with little in the way of foreign trade. However, with the coming of the Black Ships and the restoration of the Emperor, that time is long past us.

For centuries they have fought for us and commanded our armies. But in the centuries of relative peace we have enjoyed, they have forgotten the ways of war and have become a burden to the state.\nAdditionally, altercations with western forces have revealed the inadequacy of the equipment and training of our average footsoldier.

 meiji.2.f:0 "By the blessing of heaven we sit upon the sacred throne on which our ancestors reigned from time immemorial. The civilization and institutions of Japan are so different from those of other countries that we cannot expect to reach the declared end at once. It is our purpose to select from the various institutions prevailing among enlightened nations such as are best suited to our present conditions, and adapt them in gradual reforms and improvements of our policy and customs so as to be upon equality with them.\n\n—Emperor Meiji, 1891"

 meiji.14.t:0 "Collapse of Tokugawa Coinage"
 meiji.14.d:0 "The establishment of Tokugawa coinage followed a period in which Japan was dependent on Chinese bronze coinage. This system instead established a sort of gold standard with a variety of different sized gold plates and coins. The stability of this system was ensured by the near total isolation of the Japanese economy from the outside world, which is no longer the case. Foreigners have bought out large amounts of gold currency at unsustainable rates causing mass inflation and the collapse of the coinage's stability."

 meiji.19.f:0 "The former Shogun bows with respect and shame as he hands over his residence and seat of power, the mighty Edo Castle, to the restored Emperor. Renovations are set to begin at once; the old castle to be replaced by a glorious Imperial Palace. Though the exterior will appear much the same as the former imperial residence in Kyoto, the Emperor plans to combine Japan's rich decorative traditions with strange Western fashions.

On top of this our navy requires a fleet of modern armored warships to secure our sealines as we expand outwards.\n\n#lore Our people have a big fight coming. Whether we like it or not, there will have to be a big war, and that war will be a desperate war, a war in which the whole nation will be involved; a war where we are pitted against the whole world.

Failure to dislodge the current oligarchy dominating Japanese politics may forever cement the influence of the militarists over the imperial government.\n\n#lore "Democracy is not contingent on where legal theory locates sovereignty. It merely implies that in the exercise of this sovereignty, the sovereign should always make it his policy to value the well-being and opinions of the people....

 bpm_japan.2.f:0 "As a case in point, while it is natural that we show deference to a government official, this is not because of the dignity of that person's status. He is accorded that respect only because he performs that important role through his talent and virtues, and because he deals with weighty laws for the sake of the people. It is the laws which have dignity, not the man."\n\n-Fukuzawa Yukichi, 1872"
