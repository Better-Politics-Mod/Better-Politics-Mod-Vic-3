 bpm_misc.1.d:0 "\#P As of Vic3 version 1.2 it is#! \#pink NO LONGER NECESSARY#! \#P to use Better Politics Mod with Anbeeld's Revision of AI (ARoAI) active.#! \n\n If you'd like to use it, ARoAI is perfectly playable with this mod.

Socialists are related to the progress of industrialization, with ARoAI active AI countries will likely have stronger Left-wing IGs, and hence more political turmoil."
