# COMMUNITY MOD COMPATIBILITY SCRIPTED TRIGGERS #
#################################################
# FILE USAGE:
# Copy this file into the /common/scripted_triggers folder of your mod.
#
# If a mod contained in this file is not loaded, its trigger will return false.
#
# If any of the compatibility triggers in this file belong to an active mod, the trigger definition from this file should be overwritten by the one from that mod.
#
# For example, to overwrite the trigger in this file for Morgenrote and make your script think it is active, insert the following in a scripted_trigger file:
#  
# morgenrote_is_active = {
#		always = yes
# {
#
# Make sure your scripted trigger file is loaded AFTER this one. You can do this by adding zz_ to the filename.
