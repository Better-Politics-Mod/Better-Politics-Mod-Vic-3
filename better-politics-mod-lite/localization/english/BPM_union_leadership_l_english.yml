 bpm_union_leadership.1.t:0 "The Subjugation of Labor"
 bpm_union_leadership.1.desc:0 "With the Spectre of Socialism haunting our fair nation, our government was left with no choice but to recognize that some form of worker's organization was inevitable. However, that doesn't mean it capitulated. In fact, the government has consolidated the idea of the union into a new department to ensure that employers and employees can cooperate for the sake of our nation's good."
 bpm_union_leadership.1.f:0 "The trade unions that were swayed by Marxist teaching did not want social peace. They calculated that their chances of acquiring political power would improve with the growing dissatisfaction of the workers. One of the first necessities with which the Hitler Government found itself faced was that of dissolving the organizations that kept alive the antagonism between employers and employees. They were replaced by the Labour Front.\n\n—Robert Ley, 1936"
 bpm_union_leadership.1.a:0 "Good for us."


bpm_union_leadership.2.t:0 "The Liberation of Labor"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.desc:0 "In a recent move to appease the lower classes of our nation, the state union organization has been offically dissolved. Now lacking an office, its former leaders have either retired or shufflied back into the wider bureaucracy as independent labor unions reestablish themselves in workplaces all across our land."
 bpm_union_leadership.2.f:0 "I consider that every workman is well advised to join a trade union. I cannot conceive how any man standing undefended against the powers that be in this world could be so foolish, if he can possibly spare the money from the maintenance of his family, not to associate himself with an organisation to protect the rights and interests of labour.\n\n—Winston Churchill, 1911"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.a:0 "Three cheers for the people!"

bpm_union_leadership.2.t2:0 "The End of the State Union"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.desc2:0 "Our nation's leaders have recently decided that the state labor organization is a costly, unnecessary, and even potentially risky institution. As a result, they have offically dissolved the state union organization and banned any other groups that attempt to replace it. However, even as its former leaders have either retired or faded into obscurity, grassroots labor movements led by new talents presist in our nation's underground."
 bpm_union_leadership.2.f2:0 "We are asked to permit a hundred men to go round to the house of a man who wishes to exercise the common law right in this country to sell his labour where and when he chooses, and to 'advise' him or 'peacefully persuade' him not to work. If peaceful persuasion is the real object, why are a hundred men required to do it? … Every honest man knows why trade unions insist on the right to a strong numerical picket. It is because they rely for their objects neither on peacefulness nor persuasion. Those whom they picket cannot be peacefully persuaded.\n\n—F. E. Smith, 1st Earl of Birkenhead, 1906"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.a2:0 "We will get those rabble-rousers eventually."

bpm_union_leadership.2.t3:0 "The Liberation of Labor"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.desc3:0 "In a recent move to appease the lower classes of our nation, the state union organization has been offically dissolved. Now lacking an office, its former leaders have either retired or shufflied back into the wider bureaucracy as independent labor unions reestablish themselves in workplaces all across our land. However, safeguards will remain so that these unions won't get too many funny ideas"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.f3:0 "I consider that every workman is well advised to join a trade union. I cannot conceive how any man standing undefended against the powers that be in this world could be so foolish, if he can possibly spare the money from the maintenance of his family, not to associate himself with an organisation to protect the rights and interests of labour.\n\n—Winston Churchill, 1911"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.a3:0 "Moderation has won the day."

bpm_union_leadership.2.t4:0 "Labor, Resurgent"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.desc4:0 "As workers' syndicates take collective control of the state machinery, the state union organization has buckled under the strain of revolution. The former leaders have either been brought to justice or languish in obscurity as the unions they once supressed now form the backbone of our society."
 bpm_union_leadership.2.f4:0 "Go out into the field and bring in the rest of the workers, that they may be fully equipped for their great mission. We will wrest what we can, step by step, from the capitalists, but with out eye fixed upon the goal; we will press forward, keeping step together with the inspiring music of the new emancipation; and when we have enough of this kind of organization, as Brother DeLeon said so happily the other day, when we are lined up in battle array and the capitalists try to lock us out, we will turn the tables on the gentlemen and lock them out. We can run the mills without them but they cannot run them without us.\n\n—Eugene Debs, 1905"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.a4:0 "Solidarity forever!"

bpm_union_leadership.2.t5:0 "The Revolution of Labor"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.desc5:0 "In this new era of proletarian liberation, the state union organization has been struck down at last. The ones who led it have found themselves in chains or in exile as our nation's labor unions have been legalized and put under the guiding hand of bold revolutionary vanguards."
 bpm_union_leadership.2.f5:0 "to belittle the socialist ideology in any way, to turn aside from it in the slightest degree means to strengthen bourgeois ideology. There is much talk of spontaneity. But the spontaneous development of the working-class movement leads to its subordination to bourgeois ideology...; for the spontaneous working-class movement is trade-unionism..., and trade unionism means the ideological enslavement of the workers by the bourgeoisie. Hence, our task, the task of Social-Democracy, is to combat spontaneity, to divert the working-class movement from this spontaneous, trade-unionist striving to come under the wing of the bourgeoisie, and to bring it under the wing of revolutionary Social Democracy.\n\n—V. I. Lenin, 1902"
 bpm_union_leadership.2.a5:0 "Long live the Revolution!"
