# Conservative Split
  bpm_movement_splits.2.t: "The March to Modernity"
  bpm_movement_splits.2.d: "As reformism continues to develop in our nation more and more prominent leaders and thinkers have become seriously interested in developing modern political and economic institutions. The reformist movement can now be divided into two camps: the conservatives and the liberals. The former are more cautious, looking to modernize the state while maintaining a careful oligarchy bolstered by traditional institutions while making concessions to the rising bourgeoisie, while the latter are focused on meritocratic reforms, formalization of constitutionalism, and the empowering of early democratic institutions."
  bpm_movement_splits.2.f: "The outward circumstances of national wealth and power are not irrevocably fixed by nature's decree. They can be changed by the diligent efforts of men. Today's fools can become tomorrow's sages. The rich and mighty of the past can become the poor and weak today...If we begin to pursue learning with spirit and energy, so as to achieve personal independence and thereby enrich and strengthen the nation, why should we fear the powers of the west?\n -Fukuzawa Yukichi, 1872"

# Radical Split
  bpm_movement_splits.3.t: "The Radicals"
  bpm_movement_splits.3.d: "A growing faction of liberals in our nation have gained national attention. These radical liberals call for a massive overhaul of the state in favor of egalitarianism and free expression. They diverge from more moderate liberals in their desire to crush traditional institutions (including monarchies) with revolutionary fervor."
  bpm_movement_splits.3.f: "Tremble all ye oppressors of the world! Take warning all ye supporters of slavish governments, and slavish hierarchies! Call no more (absurdly and wickedly) reformation, innovation. You cannot now hold the world in darkness. Struggle no longer against increasing light and liberality. Restore to mankind their rights; and consent to the correction of abuses, before they and you are destroyed together.\n —Richard Price, 1789"

# Absolutist Split
  bpm_movement_splits.4.t: "The Absolutists"
  bpm_movement_splits.4.d: "A growing number of influential figures in our realm have adopted a philosophy of centralization under the [GetPlayer.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] under the auspices that they derive their right to rule from heaven itself and that the sovereignty of the state is derived from this truth. "
  bpm_movement_splits.4.f: "The King resembles a gardener, who plucks up the thorns and briers and throws them on one side, whereby he beautifies his garden, and at the same time raises a fence which preserves his ground from the intrusion of strangers. The King detaches from the nobles their too numerous friends and dangerous dependents. In affairs of moment it is not advisable to consult with many.\n —Abul Fazl, 1590"

# Socialist Split - PLACEHOLDER
  bpm_movement_splits.6.t: "The Socialists"
  bpm_movement_splits.6.d: "Across our nation an egalitarian movement is growing. Driven by the stark inequality evident in our growing cities, the socialist movement seeks to democratize society from the ground up. The socialists are diverse in their strategies, from founding independent communes, to sweeping reformism, to organizing popular resistance and revolution. The socialist movement is young, but it has already become a specter that haunts the powerful and emboldens the common man."
  bpm_movement_splits.6.f: "There is a tyranny, I know, far more difficult to elude or shake than that of a Nero or a Tiberius; it is the tyranny of circumstances. It is born of a corrupted social order; it is composed of ignorance, poverty, neglect, bad example, mental sufferings...in the present state of things it is thought perfectly clear and intelligible, that everyone is free to ruin himself, in order to ruin another!\n—Louis Blanc, 1839"

# Market Liberal Split
  bpm_movement_splits.7.t: "The Market Liberals"
  bpm_movement_splits.7.d: "As the debate between protectionism and free trade rages on, a contingent of liberals have doubled down on free trade and laissez-faire economic policy, seeing the freeing of markets as the most surefire way to build a prosperous and just economy. They place trust in private actors to manage resources in s fluctuating market, rapidly adjusting to the shifts in supply and demand on the global market."
  bpm_movement_splits.7.f: "The aim of protection, in short, is to prevent the bringing into a country of things in themselves useful and valuable, in order to compel the making of such things. But what all mankind in the individual affairs of every-day life, regard as to be desired is not the making of things, but the possession of things.\n -Henry George, 1896"

# National Liberal Split 
  bpm_movement_splits.8.t: "The National Liberals"
  bpm_movement_splits.8.d: "As the 19th century has marched on, the concept of liberal nationalism has grown and matured, shaped by both successes and failures. In many contemporary nation states, including ours, it has evolved into a deeply romantic movement, with those swept up in it seeking to develop a strong and modern national identity. Contemporary nationalism influences governance and culture alike, and the national liberals at the forefront of this movement make themselves known as a force in their own right."
  bpm_movement_splits.8.f: "Whatever that past generation of statesmen, law-givers and writers was capable of, we know. What they attained, what they failed to attain, we also know. Our duty and our destiny is another from theirs. Liking not at all its borrowed sound, we are yet ... a new generation; and it is for us now to inquire, what we may have it in our power to accomplish, and on what objects the world may reasonably ask that we should fix our regards.\n -Cornelius Mathews, 1845"
