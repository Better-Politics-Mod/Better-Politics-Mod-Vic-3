 bpm_marlib_split.1.d:0 "Sometimes derided as hopelessly utopian, other times accused of soulless profiteering, the @ig_market_liberals! #yellow Market Liberals#! have arrived to champion the power of the invisible hand. They promise peace through exchange, prosperity through competition, a state under the guidance of those with merit, and a society in which each individual is the architect of their own destiny."
 bpm_marlib_split.1.f:0 "By stimulating industry, by rewarding ingenuity, and by using most efficaciously the peculiar powers bestowed by nature, free commerce distributes labour most effectively and most economically: while, by increasing the general mass of productions, it diffuses general benefit, and binds together, by one common tie of interest and intercourse, the universal society of nations throughout the civilized world. \n\n—David Ricardo, 1821"
