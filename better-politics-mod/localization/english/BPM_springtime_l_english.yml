 1848.13.t:0 "The Hungry Forties"
 1848.13.d:0 "Beginning in the mid-1840s, blight and poor harvests cratered crop yields across Western Europe. The resulting famines would cause a chain reaction of economic crises, throwing the nascent industrial order into disarray and triggering political discontent in all sectors of society."
 1848.13.f:0 "The bourgeoisie, which had scarcely recovered from the depressing discovery that one of the basic pillars of its whole social order, the potato, was in danger, now sees its second pillar, cotton, threatened as well. If but a single moderately poor cotton harvest and the prospect of a second one could provoke grave alarm amid the jubilation of prosperity, a few years in succession of outright failure in cotton will inevitably hurl the whole of civilized society temporarily back into barbarism.\n\n—Karl Marx, 1850"

The Bourgeoisie, fearing for their own order, have decided that the workers' brazen hubris will not stand."
 peoples_springtime.101.f:0 "This, and the history of Germany during 1848-49, brings me to the conclusion that no revolution can be successful in Europe, unless it is from the very first proclaimed to be purely socialistic.
