  bpm_acw_events.1.t:0 "The Breaking Point"
  bpm_acw_events.1.d:0 "In hopes of containing the damage of John Brown's guerrillas via legal means, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney decided to fast track the case of Lemmon v. New York. In a 7-2 decision, the Court  held that the States do not have the right to outlaw slavery, backing the holding with talk of property rights and interstate commerce. The response from the Northern States has been blistering, with Pennsylvania and Ohio's governors openly promising to arm Brown's guerrillas if the president attempts to enforce the decision. This misstep by the Supreme Court has resigned our nation to years of bloody civil war."
  bpm_acw_events.1.f:0 ""Now, ... the right of property in a slave is distinctly and expressly affirmed in the Constitution. ... Upon these considerations, it is the opinion of the court that the act of Congress which prohibited a citizen from holding and owning property of this kind in the territory of the United States north of the line therein mentioned is not warranted by the Constitution, and is therefore void..."\n\n—Roger B. Taney, 1857"

  bpm_acw_events.2.d:0 "In response to the recent election, many states in the Deep South have called conventions to discuss the question of secession from the union. In response to these events, a senator from the Border States has promised a compromise to permanently enshrine slavery within the constitution under an unchangeable amendment. This proposal has been reject by both the new president and the secessionists. The chief executive has pointed out that there is no provision for an unchangeable amendment in the constitution, while the seccessionist demand fundamental policy guarantees to expand slavery Southward. Already, states are beginning to raid federal armouries for weapons."
  bpm_acw_events.2.f:0 ""Our new government is founded upon exactly the opposite idea; its foundations are laid, its corner-stone rests, upon the great truth that the negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery subordination to the superior race is his natural and normal condition."\n\n—Alexander H.

  bpm_acw_events.3.d:0 "As tensions boil over slavery, the @ig_radicals! Conscience Whigs have finally been able to muster enough votes among Northern Whigs and Democrats to overturn the Gag Rule. Now that slavery is once again debated in the halls of Congress, cracks within both parties' tenuous coalitions are becoming all the more apparent."

  bpm_acw_events.4.t:0 "The Whig Party Collapses"
  bpm_acw_events.4.d:0 "As slavery becomes an all-encompassing issue within American politics, it seems neither of the major parties to withstand the strain. Jacksonian Liberals have abandoned the Democratic Party, joining the old Conscience Whigs inside a new, Northern, Republican Party. Meanwhile, Cotton Whigs are left abandoned, with some joining the Democrats and others attempting to form a Constitutional Union Party. The Second Party System is over."
  bpm_acw_events.4.f:0 ""It is our purpose, gentlemen, it is the mission of the Republican Party and the basis of its organization, to resist this policy of a sectional interest.... It is our purpose and our policy to resist these new constitutional dogmas that slavery exists by virtue of the constitution wherever the banner of the Union floats."\n\n—David Wilmot, 1860"

  bpm_acw_events.5.d:0 "As long as America has been independent, there have been some among our citizens who wish to expand the light of liberty via less-than-legal means. It seems a new crop of these 'filibusters' has now taken center stage, with raids into Honduras, Nicaragua, and Cota Rica all being attempted. These men plan to expand American civilization and slavery to their conquests, with the final goal of integrating such nations into our union to ensure slave state supremacy. Do we assist these brave fighters and risk upsetting the European Powers with interests in Central America? Do we try to put a stop to these vagabonds before they start an international incident? Or should we take a wait-and-see approach? If we take a decisive stand, it will have major societal effects when a sectional war occurs..."

  bpm_acw_events.6.d:0 "In an ongoing case, Roger B. Taney, Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, has questioned the legality of the Wilmot Proviso. He views the Proviso, as well as the Missouri Compromise that preceeded it, as unconstitutional, and is trying to convince his fellow justices to strike it down. Whatever the final decision, this conflict has already reignited tensions over the Mexican Territories. What will the Court decide?"
  bpm_acw_events.6.f:0 ""Provided, That, as an express and fundamental condition to the acquisition of any territory from the Republic of Mexico by the United States, by virtue of any treaty which may be negotiated between them, and to the use by the Executive of the moneys herein appropriated, neither slavery nor involuntary servitude shall ever exist in any part of said territory, except for crime, whereof the party shall first be duly convicted."\n\n—Wilmot Proviso, 1846"

  bpm_acw_events.7.t:0 "Fugitive Slave Act Nullified"
  bpm_acw_events.7.d:0 "The Wisconsin Supreme Court has declared the Fugitive Slave Act portion of the Great Compromise unconstitutional. This decision flies in the face of the supremacy of the Supreme Court, and threatens to embolden Northern legislatures to oppose US Marshalls attempting to recapture escaped slaves. The Supreme Court recognizes this case cannot stand, but is unsure if it should fast track such a delicate matter. What will the Court decide?"
  bpm_acw_events.7.f:0 ""This Constitution, and the laws of the United States which shall be passed in pursuance thereof, and all treaties made, or which shall be made, under the authority of the United States, shall be the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every State shall be bound thereby, anything in the Constitution or laws of any State to the contrary notwithstanding."\n\n—Roger B. Taney, 1858"

  bpm_acw_events.9.t:0 "Dred Scott v. Sandford"
  bpm_acw_events.9.d:0 "Dred Scott was an enslaved man whose enslavers took him into the free state of Illinois and the free territory of Wisconsin. After being brough back to the slave state of Missouri, Scott sued for his freedom, claiming that because he had been taken into free states and territories, he had automatically been freed and was legally no longer a slave. This case has now reached the Supreme Court, with Chief Justice Roger B. Taney planning to write what future historians will call the worst decision in judicial history. However, the other 6 aligned justices are hesistant to take such an aggressive move against abolition, for fear of sectional crisis. How will the president intervene in this fragile judicial situation?"
  bpm_acw_events.9.f:0 ""No rights which the White Man was bound to respect"\n\n-Roger B. Taney, 1857"
  bpm_acw_events.9.a:0 "The President pressures the Justices to support Taney, who promptly proves states' rights a hypocrisy. 7 to 2, the sins of this guilty nation are written in ink, to be washed away with blood."
  bpm_acw_events.9.b:0 "The President pressures Taney to work with his fellow Justices, and Scott is recognized as a citizen but not free. The South ignores the later for the former, and begins spitting fire."

  bpm_acw_events.10.t:0 "John Brown's Raid"
  bpm_acw_events.10.d1:0 "The "abolitionist filibuster" John Brown has launched a slave insurreciton in Harpers Ferry. After successfully isolating the town and seizing the armoury, Brown with the help of Harriet Tubman's network mobilized over 500 slaves and fled into the Appalachian Mountains. Brown is now harrying every slave state bordering the mountain range, using the Underground Railroad to spirit those who cannot fight to safety and arming and training those who can to liberate more of their brothers and sisters. The South is demanding Pennsylvania and Ohio to crack down on Brown's supply network in their states, but the local governments stalwartly refuse."
  bpm_acw_events.10.d2:0 "The "abolitionist filibuster" John Brown has launched an attempted slave insurrection in Harpers Ferry. A series of chance mistakes led to the collapse of the plan, with John Brown being captured and later hanged. However, Northern Newspapers have quickly transformed the image of Brown into that of Martyr, rallying Abolitionists for the next fight. The South is now terrified of what will happen when another John Brown strikes South, or worse: when an anti-slavery president uses the military to enact a similar plan."

  bpm_acw_events.11.d:0 "With our intentions to obtain Northern Mexico now evident to all, abolitionists and slavers have begun debating on how slavery should be handled in any newly-obtained territories. David Wilmot has proposed a proviso that will ban any expansion of slavery into the territories, while Stephen A. Douglas and Henry Clay argue for a new compromise that will resolve the problems of the Missouri Compromise with the new theory of popular sovereignty. What shall Congress decide?"
  bpm_acw_events.11.f:0 ""I deny the right of Congress to force a slaveholding State upon an unwilling people. I deny their right to force a free State upon an unwilling people. I deny their right to force a good thing upon a people who are unwilling to receive it. The great principle is the right of every community to judge and decide for itself, whether a thing is right or wrong, whether it would be good or evil for them to adopt it; and the right of free action, the right of free thought, the right of free judgment upon the question is dearer to every true American than any other under a free government."\n\n—Stephen A.

However, with our intentions to obtain Cuba and the Caribbean now evident to all, we need a justification for our new policy. This has been done by expanding the Monroe Doctrine, removing the existing colonies clause. This decision has caused outrage in the North, who fear the establishment of sugar empires by Southerners will allow Slaver Power to enshrine its dominance over the federal government."
