However, ARoAI speeds up industrialization to somewhat ahistorical levels. Since the strength of e.g. @ig_liberals! Liberals and @ig_socialists! Socialists are related to the progress of industrialization, with ARoAI active AI countries will likely have stronger Left-wing IGs, and hence more political turmoil."
