For some, he was a great man, an incredible reformer who brought Russia out of darkness and decay of past, using the best from the West, modernizing it for the challenges of the future. For others he's a source of national tragedy, a fool who dared to transplant the incompatible values of the foreign civilization onto the sovereign spirit of Russia. Admittedly, his figure alone isn't the only divisive thing for the two philosophical currents that came to dominate Russian Intelligentsia for coming decades — the Zapadniks and Slavophiles.\n\n$bpm_je_all_zapadniks$ are a current within Russian Intelligentsia that desire to emulate the West and take from them what they percieve are its best innovations — liberalism, democracy, human rights and economic freedom in order to save Russia from the backward state it found itself in, following in the footsteps of their great national hero — Peter the Great.\n\n$bpm_je_all_slavophiles$ are an opposing current to Zapadniks — they believe that Russian national spirit has already been too trampled by western influence and that it is too egoistic, secular and revolutionary to fit with the collective, Christian and loyalist Russian Spirit.\n\nThis Journal Entry represents the influence that these two positions have in the minds of Russian academia relative to each other. Should either one of them prevail, you will gain a scaled modifier to various research fields — stronger $bpm_je_all_slavophiles$ will cause faster #bold Military#! and #bold Industrial#! research whereas $bpm_je_all_zapadniks$ will shift the attention towards #bold Technological Spread#! and #bold Social#! research.

The country was torn apart by struggles that threatened its unity: revolutionary outbreaks in Rio de Janeiro, Maranhão, and Pará. The most recent was the military sedition of Ouro Preto in 1833. The Senate was conservative, although far from being "the slavery of D. Pedro I," as it was called by the newspaper O Sete de Abril. The 1833 elections sent a moderate [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('liberals_ig').GetName] majority to the Chamber of Deputies, and by the law of October 12, 1833, deputies were vested with constituent powers. The Additional Act was a direct result of this majority, which advocated greater autonomy for the provinces. Ratified on August 12, 1834, it adapted federalist principles to the monarchy. This caused conflicts between the central government and the provinces for control. [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('conservatives_ig').GetName] accuse the act of having turned the country into an "anarchy" and argue that it must be reviewed. Will the liberal dream of a federative monarchy be maintained, or will a “conservative restoration” be necessary to implement order?"
