 ig_rus_obschina:0 "Obschinas"
 ig_rus_obschina_desc:0 "The Obschina is a traditional form of communal self-organization of peasants, utilized by the Russian government to better administer the land. Responsible for taxation, conscription and rural policing, these relatively autonomous and somewhat informal governance units were also taking significant part in economic management of their respective local rural communities. One of the few places in Russian Empire where the elections of their respective local leaders (the Starosta) were the norm, these social institutions unsurprisingly inspired a movement of Russian Agrarian Socialism called Narodniks."

 ig_rus_obschina_rural_desc:0 "The Rural Obschina is a rural self-governance institution, tracing its roots to the original Russian Obschina which managed to survive even into the recent socialist revolution. Reformed to abolish the inefficiencies of Chernopolositsa and freed from the yoke of serfdom and aristocracy, the reorganized Rural Obschina now stands as an autonomous self-governing unit of the new socialist regime and a proud prototype for its urban counterpart."
