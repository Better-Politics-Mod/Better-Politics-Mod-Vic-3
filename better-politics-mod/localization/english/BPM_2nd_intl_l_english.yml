 bpm_2nd_intl.1.t:0 "Seeds of a New International"
 bpm_2nd_intl.1.d:0 "It is generally acknowledged among socialists that the interests of the working class transcend political borders. Since the end of the International Workingmen's Association, however, no serious attempts have been made at founding a new international association of socialists. To remedy this, delegates from various worker's organizations met today in Switzerland, where it has been decided that a new socialist manifesto should be drafted as the founding document of a Second International."
 bpm_2nd_intl.1.f:0 "In the proletariat of the Old World and the New, a spirit of concord prevails. Among the suffering and the oppressed there is increasing hatred of their exploiters, increasing distrust of their capitalist oppressors. Do you not feel, brothers, that this is the decisive hour?\n\n—The Brussels Congress, 1880"
 bpm_2nd_intl.1.a:0 "Let's keep an eye on this."

 bpm_2nd_intl.2.t:0 "The International and its Discontents"
 bpm_2nd_intl.2.d:0 "The convening of a new International did not go as planned. Besides being poorly organized, it seems that the socialist movement is shot with divisions. Chief among these is the split between reformists and revolutionists, who have fallen out over a practical issue — the former insist that only bona fide delegates should be able to attend the new congress, whereas the latter argue that only anonymity can ensure the safety of all participants. Unable to compromise, both camps have begun organizing separate conventions."
 bpm_2nd_intl.2.f:0 "The Congress assembled. Never in the whole history of the working class movement has a Working Men's Congress met under such humiliating conditions.\n\n—Eduard Bernstein, 1889"
 bpm_2nd_intl.2.a:0 "Discord among rabble rousers? Good!"

 bpm_2nd_intl.2b.t:0 "Our Socialists Split!"
 bpm_2nd_intl.2b.d:0 "Disagreements over the new International have caused rippled effects in our country, exacerbating existing rifts within the socialist movement. The newly formed @ig_socialists!Reformist and @ig_communists!Revolutionist factions still nominally work together, but a deepened crisis may end any semblance of cooperation."
 bpm_2nd_intl.2b.f:0 "This is the nucleus of the question which causes all the differences. Is the antagonism between the middle class and the proletariat so great as to prevent the proletariat from allying itself with certain factions of the middle class against other groups of the middle class? Or are there within the middle class enmities greater than the hostility which exists between the middle class and the working class?\n\n—Karl Kautsky, 1902"
 bpm_2nd_intl.2b.a:0 "I see."

 bpm_2nd_intl.3.t:0 "The Possibilist International"
 bpm_2nd_intl.3.d:0 "Leading the reformist socialists are the French Possibilists and the British Trades Union Congress. Rejecting the hardline rhetoric of what they call the 'Marxist Clique', the Possibilists choose to prioritize achieving what is currently possible — incremental reforms — on the path towards attaining socialism in general. The Possibilist congress has resolved to push for, among other things, the eight-hour workday and workplace democracy."
 bpm_2nd_intl.3.f:0 "That this International Labour Congress declares that its resolutions in favour of a reduction of the hours of labour, the limitation of child labour and kindred measures, are not to be considered as expressing its full programme of Industrial Reform, but that those measures are demanded to secure the present mitigation of the hardships of labour, and to promote the leisure, education and organisation necessary to secure the ultimate ownership and control of all the means of production by the workers themselves.\n\n—The Possibilist Congress, 1889"
 bpm_2nd_intl.3.a:0 "What of the Marxists?"

 bpm_2nd_intl.4.t:0 "The Marxist International"
 bpm_2nd_intl.4.d:0 "Opposing the reformists are the revolutionists, united under the banner of Marxism along with Blanquists and various other traditions. Broadly, the Marxists see agitation for reforms as a means of building revolutionary class consciousness rather than as an end in itself, prioritizing revolution as the only way to achieve socialism. They often work under illegality and, as such, accuse the Possibilists of being officially-endorsed 'Ministerial Socialists' opposed to the true socialist cause."
 bpm_2nd_intl.4.f:0 "Let but the Eight Hour Day alone be realised, and the first step will have been gained in the road to the final emancipation of Labour. It will be gained not perhaps so much on account of its intrinsic value, as because of the consciousness of power that it will give to workingmen when acting internationally.\n\n—Cunninghame Graham, 1889"
 bpm_2nd_intl.4.a:0 "Dangerous criminals."

 bpm_2nd_intl.5.t:0 "After the Congresses"
 bpm_2nd_intl.5.d:0 "The Possibilist and Marxist congresses have met, accompanied by a chaotic exchange of fiery polemics that often descended into personal attacks. The actual contents of the congresses were remarkably similar — both pushed for an eight-hour workday, both pushed for the equality of women, both instituted May Day as a workers' holiday, and both were subject to infighting over unity with their wayward comrades. Nonetheless, the schism over means and ends runs deep, and the prospect of mending it seems thin."
 bpm_2nd_intl.5.f:0 "This Congress brilliantly opens up a new era of the conscious, systematic enforcement of the rights of the oppressed, planned, unanimous action by the international proletariat and socialism. It is the pledge of certain and decisive victory; long live the social international republic!\n\n—The Marxist Congress, 1889"
 bpm_2nd_intl.5.a:0 "Let's hope they stay enemies."

 bpm_2nd_intl.6.t:0 "Sera le Genre Humain?"
 bpm_2nd_intl.6.d:0 "Some time has passed since the turbulence of the opposed international congresses. The personal enmities stoked by the event have calmed; though both sides are once again preparing to convene their own congresses, they have sent delegates to one another in the hopes of joining in a united congress.\n\nWill reformists and revolutionists reunite, or will they go the way of socialists and anarchists decades before? (This choice affects the willingness of reformists and revolutionists to join in one party.)"
 bpm_2nd_intl.6.f:0 "Such a bridging of the chasm between the nations, such an international amalgamation of great sections of the people of different lands, the history of the world has never seen before. This phenomenon appears the more imposing when we remember that it has come into existence under the shadow of military armaments which, on their part, also offer a spectacle the like of which has never before been seen in the world.\n\n—Karl Kautsky, 1892"
 bpm_2nd_intl.6.a:0 "The two unite — for now. (Historical)"
 bpm_2nd_intl.6.b:0 "The two remain separate."
