  1834_additional_act.1.t: "The Conservative Regency"
  1834_additional_act.1.d: "After long political turmoil between the central government and the autonomous provinces, [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('conservatives_scope').GetName] seek to elect [SCOPE.sCharacter('araujo_lima_regent').GetLastName] as the new regent to revoke liberal reforms and centralize power."
  #1834_additional_act.1.f: "\n\n#lore "I was a liberal; then freedom was new in the country, it was in everyone's aspirations, but not in the laws, power was everything: I was a liberal. Today, however, the aspect of society is different: democratic principles won everything and compromised a lot ; society, which was then at risk due to power, is now at risk due to disorganization and anarchy. As I wanted then, today I want to serve it, I want to save it; and that's why I'm a regressive. I am not a transfugee, I do not abandon the cause that I defend, in the day of its dangers, of its weakness; I leave her on the day when her triumph is so certain that even success compromises her. Who knows if, as today I defend the country against disorganization, after having defended it against despotism and military commissions, I will not one day have to give my voice again in support and defense of freedom?… The dangers of society vary; the wind of storms is not always the same: how can the politician, blind and immutable, serve his country?\"\n\n—[SCOPE.sCharacter('bernardo_scope').GetLastName]#!"
