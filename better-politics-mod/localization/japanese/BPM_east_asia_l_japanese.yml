The forcing open of our ports has led to the collapse of our banking system and the flooding of our ports with foreigners, including missionaries. Many Daimyos and members of the imperial house are beginning to believe radical change is needed to secure Japan from foreign domination.\n\nSome are calling this the #v Bakumatsu#!, the end of the Shogunate.\n\nProgress towards the end of the shogunate is made on a monthly basis by #P 1#! each month.

 je_bpm_secure_shogunate_reason:0 "The Tokugawa clan has lead Japan as shoguns since the 17th century, establishing a time of order and isolation off the heels of the warring states period. However, not all power in Japan lies in the palm of the Shogun and his clan, regional Daimyo lords privately control vast swaths of the country and command legions of men at arms and Samurai. This careful balance of policy has been shattered by European intervention and the imposition of treaties bringing and end to Sakoku isolation.\n\nTo preserve the Tokugawa shogunate and rebuke the restorationists certain careful reforms must be taken to secure power before the Tokugawa clan loses its credibility and grasp on power."

 meiji.14.d:0 "The establishment of Tokugawa coinage followed a period in which Japan was dependent on Chinese bronze coinage. This system instead established a sort of gold standard with a variety of different sized gold plates and coins. The stability of this system was ensured by the near total isolation of the Japanese economy from the outside world, which is no longer the case. Foreigners have bought out large amounts of gold currency at unsustainable rates causing mass inflation and the collapse of the coinage's stability."
