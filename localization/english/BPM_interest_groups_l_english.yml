 ig_agrarian_populists_desc:0 "Agrarian Populists do not come from a single tradition, and can vary greatly even within one country.

On the radical end, such as the French Possibilists and the German USPD, are those who prioritize reforms in the present while holding revolution as a long-term goal. In the middle are those who believe that socialism can be attained by reforms alone, such as Eduard Bernstein's faction in the SPD.

# Liberals

 ig_radicals_only_icon:0 "@ig_radicals!"
 ig_radicals_desc:0 "Radical liberals take the ideals of their moderate cousins to their logical end. They agitate for full democracy and social egalitarianism, resorting to revolutionary means where official politics is impossible. As such, they may overlap with socialists early on, though they would grow more moderate over time. Examples include the French Radicals, the 1848 revolutionaries, American Radical Republicans, and Sun Yat-sen's KMT."

Examples include the Radical-Socialists of the French Third Republic and Teddy Roosevelt's Bull-Moose Party."

 ig_reactionaries_only_icon:0 "@ig_reactionaries!"
 ig_reactionaries_desc:0 "Reactionaries are a broad tent of those who want to go back to the good old days, who unlike niche interest groups elevate their nostalgia to a general politics.

 ig_fascists:0 "Fascists"
 ig_fascists_only_icon:0 "@ig_fascists!"
 ig_fascists_desc:0 "An extreme-right ideology, fascism is difficult to define in specific terms. Generally characterized by national chauvinism, a reverence of the state, and a rabid hostility to any Left-wing or perceived foreign elements, it is just as much inundated with contradictions -- while fascists often espouse deeply traditional values, they also glorify the efficiency of modern industry and war. This strange coupling of traditionalism with modernity is part of what sets e.g. clerical fascism apart from traditional moralism, and Italian Futurism apart from socialism."
