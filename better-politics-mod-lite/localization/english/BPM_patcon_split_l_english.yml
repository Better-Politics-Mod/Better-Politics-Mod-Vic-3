 bpm_patcon_split.1.d:0 "The power of the state grows from the power of the people, and that which is responsible to the people should provide for their common wellbeing.\n\nSo says, that is, the new crop of  @ig_conservatives! #blue Paternal Conservatives#! that have grown to dominate the conservative movement, who promise to protect their countrymen from the cruelties of the modern world. Those unwilling to modernize, in turn, have fallen into the @ig_reactionaries! Reactionaries, as the last stronghold of their patrician past."
 bpm_patcon_split.1.f:0 "I have always looked upon the interests of the labouring classes as essentially the most conservative interests of the country. The rights of labour have been to me always as sacred as the rights of property, and I have always thought that those who were most interested in the stability and even in the glory of a State are the great mass of the population. \n\n—Benjamin Disraeli, 1867"
