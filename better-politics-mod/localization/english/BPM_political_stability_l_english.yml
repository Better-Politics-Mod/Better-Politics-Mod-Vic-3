 concept_bpm_political_stability_desc:0 "Political Stability represents the level of dynamism or stagnation of political forces in your country.\n\nPolitical Stability influences the popularity of [Concept('concept_bpm_institutional_ig', 'Institutional')] [Concept('concept_interest_group', 'Interest Groups')], with higher stability making these groups more attractive for your population. Having Political Stability above 66% will make your country [Concept('concept_bpm_politically_stagnant', 'Stagnant')], and having Political Stability below 33% will, instead, make your country [Concept('concept_bpm_politically_unstable', 'Unstable')]. Staying in between these two opposites will keep your country [Concept('concept_bpm_politically_dynamic', 'Dynamic')] and is usually the more desirable option.\n\nCurrently, your Political Stability is trending towards #tooltippable;tooltip:[GetPlayer.GetTooltipTag],bpm_political_stability_baseline_tooltip [GetPlayer.MakeScope.ScriptValue('bpm_political_stability_baseline_target')]#! at the monthly rate of #tooltippable;tooltip:[GetPlayer.GetTooltipTag],bpm_political_stability_rate_tooltip [GetPlayer.MakeScope.ScriptValue('bpm_political_stability_rate')|+=]#!."
