Across Germany, industrialists and workers alike now flock to the banner of @ig_national_liberals!National Liberalism, which promises civil liberties, a strong state, a secure livelihood, and above all a united Germany built upon the great tradition of German idealism."
 bpm_natlib_split.1.f:0 "An act which emanates from the political authority is a universal act, and by virtue of its true universality, it also bears the rule of its application within itself. What it refers to is universal and identical with itself. The act of the political authority imparts a free and universal determinacy, and its execution is at the same time its application. Since no distinctions can be made in what it applies to, its application must be defined in the act itself, and no refractory or disparate material offers resistance in its application. \n\n—G.W.F. Hegel, 1802"

 bpm_natlib_split.3.f:0 "Some men who are not real men love other things about themselves, but the real man believes that his honor is dearer than his life; and a nation is merely all of us put together, and the nation's honor is dearer than the nation's comfort and the nation's peace and the nation's life itself. \n\n—Woodrow Wilson, 1916"

 bpm_natlib_split.4.t:0 "The Return of Bonapartism"
 bpm_natlib_split.4.d:0 "As old Napoleon rests in his tomb, his heirs claw their way back into the world of the living. There, they discover an ancient, crumbling Paris, surrounded by a weak and divided kingdom, infested with poverty and despair. Disappointed, they look to their leader— #blue Louis Napoleon Bonaparte#!, nephew of the Emperor, two coups under his belt, gilded with the glory that had so inspired a generation of Frenchmen prior. Though today they find themselves ridiculed by the gentlemen of the July Monarchy, soon the people of France will decide if they prefer the strong hand of a Bonaparte after all."

 bpm_natlib_split.5.f:0 "The first condition of unity is a subjective principle; and this principle in the Positive system is the subordination of the intellect to the heart: Without this the unity that we seek can never be placed on a permanent basis, whether individually or collectively. It is essential to have some influence sufficiently powerful to produce convergence amid the heterogeneous and often antagonistic tendencies of so complex an organism as ours. \n\n—Auguste Comte, 1844"
