 je_meiji_restoration:0 "The Bakumatsu"
 je_meiji_restoration_reason:0 "#lore "With many little strokes a large tree is felled."\n—Japansese Proverb#!\n\nThe powers of the west have crashed upon the shores of Japan, and the policy of Sakoku has left Japan weak. The forcing open of our ports has led to the collapse of our banking system and the flooding of our ports with foreigners, including missionaries. Many Daimyos and members of the imperial house are beginning to believe radical change is needed to secure Japan from foreign domination.\n\nSome are calling this the #v Bakumatsu#!, the end of the Shogunate.\n\nProgress towards the end of the shogunate is made on a monthly basis from the following factors:\n#P +#! Having the @landowners! #YB Daimyo Interests#! removed from government\n#P +#! Including @petty_bourgeoisie! #YB Kuge Interests#! in government\n#P +#! Having Appointed Bureaucrats enacted\n\nEach of these will increase progress by #P 1#! each month. Events may also occur that allow for jumps in progress towards a restoration."

 je_bpm_secure_shogunate:0 "Shoring up the Shogunate"
 je_bpm_secure_shogunate_reason:0 "The Tokugawa clan has lead Japan as shoguns since the 17th century, establishing a time of order and isolation off the heels of the warring states period. However, not all power in Japan lies in the palm of the Shogun and his clan, regional Daimyo lords privately control vast swaths of the country and command legions of men at arms and Samurai. This careful balance of policy has been shattered by European intervention and the imposition of treaties bringing and end to Sakoku isolation. To preserve the shogunate now certain careful reforms must be taken to secure power before the Tokugawa clan loses its credibility and grasp on power."

 meiji.14.t:0 "Collapse of Tokugawa Coinage"
 meiji.14.d:0 "The establishment of Tokugawa coinage followed a period in which Japan was dependent on Chinese bronze coinage. This system instead established a sort of gold standard with a variety of different sized gold plates and coins. The stability of this system was ensured by the near total isolation of the Japanese economy from the outside world, which is no longer the case. Foreigners have bought out large amounts of gold currency at unsustainable rates causing mass inflation and the collapse of the coinage's stability."
 meiji.14.f:0 "The commoner looked with disdain at the prices listed on the butcher's cart, prices doubling from the month before, the few coins in his pocket worth less with every day that passed."
 meiji.14.a:0 "There is little we can do now."

 meiji.15.t:0 "Portside Clash"
 meiji.15.d:0 "A disagreement between local guardsmen and foreign traders has escalated to a deadly brawl at a Japanese port. Among the casualties are several sailors and guards."
 meiji.15.f:0 "The sound of blades and clubs colliding with flesh, the echoing of yells and screams across the dockyard drew countless onlookers."
 meiji.15.a:0 "Demand that the local daimyo changes the guard."

 meiji.16.t:0 "Sonnō Jōi Groups Meet"
 meiji.16.d:0 "Sonnō jōi (revere the emperor, expel the barbarians) is a rallying cry of several neo-confucian and restorationist groups that seek to empower the emperor and strengthen Japan against the westerners. They are directly opposed to the shogunate which they see as weak."
 meiji.16.f:0 ""The shogun has caved time and time again to the westerners and their black ships, NO MORE, only those loyal to the emperor and his will can protect us now.""
 meiji.16.a:0 "Cracks spread beneath the shogun's domain."
