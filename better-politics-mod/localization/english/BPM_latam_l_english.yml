This document was replaced by the "Seven Laws" reorganizing Mexico into a unitary republic, with government power centralized in entirely in Mexico City, as well as tightening qualifications for elected office and the implementation of a fourth branch of government: The Supreme Conservative Power.\n\nWhile Intended to bring stability to the historically tumultuous nation, separatist and federalist movements threaten to disrupt the new order. If the centralist republic is to survive it must build public trust and quench the fires of rebellion.\n\n#lore "In the name of Almighty God, triune and one, by whom men are destined to form societies, and those which they form are preserved; the Representatives of the Mexican Nation...delegated by it to constitute it in the manner which they understand to be most conducive to its happiness, assembled to be most conducive to their happiness, gathered for this purpose."\n\n—Preamble to the Constitution of 1836#!"
