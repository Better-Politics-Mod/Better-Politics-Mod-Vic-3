 communism.1.t:1 "A Party of the Whole Proletariat?"
 communism.1.desc:1 "No more just a smattering of sects, the labor movement now rallies behind the banner of the #N Socialist Party#! — though already this accomplishment is under grave internal threats. In many places, old disagreements were only plastered over. If we offer certain concessions, we may just be able to break them apart once more."
 communism.1.f:1 "German social democracy would have arisen with or without Lassalle, just as the class struggle of the international proletariat would have become the predominant factor of recent history with or without Marx and Engels. Yet the fact that the German proletarian class party already appeared at the gates with such radiance and splendour 50 years ago, more than two decades before all other countries, and acted as a role model for them, is thanks to Lassalle's life work and his maxim: 'I dared!'\n\n—Rosa Luxemburg, 1913"
 communism.1.a:1 "Offer greater wages for their labor."

 communism.10.f: "Brought into existence by Lassalle, German social democracy was the first historic attempt to create a permanent organisation of the masses, the majority of the people, for class struggle. Thanks to Lassalle’s political action and thanks to Marx’s theory, German social democracy has radiantly solved this new task.\n\n—Rosa Luxemburg, 1913"
