 je_bpm_1834_additional_act_reason:0 "Three years after the abdication of Emperor D. Pedro I, which occurred in 1831, no reform had yet been made to the Brazilian constitution of 1824. The country was torn apart by struggles that threatened its unity: revolutionary outbreaks in Rio de Janeiro, Maranhão, and Pará. The most recent was the military sedition of Ouro Preto in 1833. The Senate was conservative, although far from being "the slavery of D. Pedro I," as it was called by the newspaper O Sete de Abril. The 1833 elections sent a [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('liberals_ig').GetName] majority to the Chamber of Deputies, and by the law of October 12, 1833, deputies were vested with constituent powers. The Additional Act was a direct result of this majority, which advocated greater autonomy for the provinces. Ratified on August 12, 1834, it adapted federalist principles to the monarchy. This caused conflicts between the central government and the provinces for control. [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('conservatives_ig').GetName] accuse the act of having turned the country into an "anarchy" and argue that it must be reviewed. Will the liberal dream of a federative monarchy be maintained, or will a “conservative restoration” be necessary to implement order?"
