 bpm_marlib_split.1.d:0 "Sometimes derided as hopelessly utopian, other times accused of soulless profiteering, the @ig_market_liberals! #yellow Market Liberals#! have arrived to champion the power of the invisible hand. They promise peace through exchange, prosperity through competition, a state under the guidance of those with merit, and a society in which each individual is the architect of their own destiny."
 bpm_marlib_split.1.f:0 "By stimulating industry, by rewarding ingenuity, and by using most efficaciously the peculiar powers bestowed by nature, free commerce distributes labour most effectively and most economically: while, by increasing the general mass of productions, it diffuses general benefit, and binds together, by one common tie of interest and intercourse, the universal society of nations throughout the civilized world. \n\n—David Ricardo, 1821"

 bpm_marlib_split.2.d:0 "Sometimes regarded as overly pragmatic, other times praised for their emphasis on the greater good, the @ig_market_liberals! #yellow Utilitarians#! have emerged as proponents of maximizing happiness for the greatest number of people. They advocate for policies that balance individual freedoms with societal welfare, aiming to create a more equitable and efficient society."
 bpm_marlib_split.2.f:0 "The greatest happiness of the greatest number is the foundation of morals and legislation. By prioritizing actions that increase overall well-being and reduce suffering, we can build a society that thrives on rational principles and humanitarian values. \n\n—Jeremy Bentham, 1789"
