 bpm_lobby.1.t:0 "Ultranationalist Hijacking"
 bpm_lobby.1.d:0 "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('relevant_ig').GetName] are using the existing animosity towards [SCOPE.sCountry('relevant_lobby_country').GetName] to expand their own power base using their fiery, ultramilitaristic rhetoric, and they seek to join [SCOPE.sPoliticalLobby('relevant_lobby').GetName] as soon as possible to push for militaristic action against [SCOPE.sCountry('relevant_lobby_country').GetNameNoFormatting]."
 bpm_lobby.1.f:0 "Their rallies filled out entire streets. They see the plight of common man, or so they claim. And they know the source of that plight - or so they claim. Their cure is disarmingly simple in its violence - war."
 bpm_lobby.1.a:0 "Their drive will help our interests"
 bpm_lobby.1.a2:0 "[SCOPE.sCountry('relevant_lobby_country').GetNameNoFormatting] must be eliminated!"
 bpm_lobby.1.b:0 "Their words are not that inspiring"

 bpm_lobby.2.t:0 "Crimson Crescendo"
 bpm_lobby.2.d:0 "The [SCOPE.gsInterestGroup('relevant_ig').GetName], using the fertile soil of [SCOPE.sPoliticalLobby('relevant_lobby').GetName]'s hate of [SCOPE.sCountry('relevant_lobby_country').GetName] and political connections in our current government are demanding war with [SCOPE.sCountry('relevant_lobby_country').GetNameNoFormatting]."
 bpm_lobby.2.f:0 "The discordant cacophany of militarism permeating the country's fascistic circles is reaching its crimson crescendo. Their demands are simple - we go to war with [SCOPE.sCountry('relevant_lobby_country').GetNameNoFormatting], and we do it as soon as possible. For the sake of the safety of our nation, so these fanatics claim."
 bpm_lobby.2.a:0 "Of course! [SCOPE.sCountry('relevant_lobby_country').GetNameNoFormatting] must burn!"
 bpm_lobby.2.b:0 "This is insanity!"
