# Socialists are split on bourgeois republican electoralism. They also were split on the same question a century before because some things never change.
# Socialists will become more electoralist if:
# * There are powerful socialist IGs in the country 
# * Any socialist IGs are in government 
# * We have the Right of Assembly or even better, Protected Speech 
# * We have Guaranteed Liberties (bonus for every level of institution)
# * There are very happy non-marginal socialist IGs 
# * There is a revolution brewing  
# * Non-marginal socialist IGs are getting bolstered 
# Socialists will become more anti-electoralist if:
# * There's Censorship or even worse, Outlawed Dissent
# * We have Secret Police (penalty for every level of institution)
# * We have angry non-marginal socialist IGs
# * Socialist IGs are getting suppressed 
# These factors together will form the baseline value to which the JE's progress bar will trend.
