  1834_additional_act.1.d: "In poor health, discouraged and without the same energy that characterized him when he was in charge of the Ministry of Justice, [SCOPE.sCharacter('feijo_regent').GetLastName] ended up becoming unpopular due to his intransigence and, losing the support of his great ally Evaristo da Veiga, who had died prematurely, he was unable to form the ministry he wanted and ended up resigning. He appointed the thoughtful and tolerant conservative [SCOPE.sCharacter('araujo_lima_regent').GetLastName] as Acting Regent."
  #1834_additional_act.1.f: "\n\n#lore "I was a liberal; then freedom was new in the country, it was in everyone's aspirations, but not in the laws, power was everything: I was a liberal. Today, however, the aspect of society is different: democratic principles won everything and compromised a lot ; society, which was then at risk due to power, is now at risk due to disorganization and anarchy. As I wanted then, today I want to serve it, I want to save it; and that's why I'm a regressive. I am not a transfugee, I do not abandon the cause that I defend, in the day of its dangers, of its weakness; I leave her on the day when her triumph is so certain that even success compromises her. Who knows if, as today I defend the country against disorganization, after having defended it against despotism and military commissions, I will not one day have to give my voice again in support and defense of freedom?… The dangers of society vary; the wind of storms is not always the same: how can the politician, blind and immutable, serve his country?\"\n\n—[SCOPE.sCharacter('bernardo_scope').GetLastName]#!"
