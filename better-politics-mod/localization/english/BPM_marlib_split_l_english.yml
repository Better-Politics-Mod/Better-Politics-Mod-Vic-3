 bpm_marlib_split.1.d:0 "Sometimes derided as utopian, other times accused of soulless profiteering, the @ig_market_liberals!Market Liberals have arrived to champion the power of the invisible hand. They promise peace through exchange, prosperity through competition, a state under the guidance of those with merit, and a society in which each individual is the architect of their own destiny."
 bpm_marlib_split.1.f:0 "By stimulating industry, by rewarding ingenuity, and by using most efficaciously the peculiar powers bestowed by nature, free commerce distributes labour most effectively and most economically: while, by increasing the general mass of productions, it diffuses general benefit, and binds together, by one common tie of interest and intercourse, the universal society of nations throughout the civilized world. \n\n—David Ricardo, 1821"
 bpm_marlib_split.1.a:0 "The market will provide!"

 bpm_fascist_split.1.t:0 "Fascists"
 bpm_fascist_split.1.d:0 "A new force of reaction arises, the @ig_fascists!Fascists. An ultranationalist movement, they advocate for a state ordered on class collaboration and unyielding loyalty to the nation."
 bpm_fascist_split.1.f:0 "The masses have a right to change property relations; Fascism seeks to give them an expression while preserving property. The logical result of Fascism is the introduction of aesthetics into political life. The violation of the masses, whom Fascism, with its Führer cult, forces to their knees, has its counterpart in the violation of an apparatus which is pressed into the production of ritual values. \n\n—Walter Benjamin, 1936"
 bpm_fascist_split.1.a:0 "The nation marches on!"
