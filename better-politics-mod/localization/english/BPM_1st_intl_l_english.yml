 bpm_1st_intl.1.t:0 "The First International"
 bpm_1st_intl.1.d:0 "The early @ig_socialists! Socialist movement did not grow from one united tradition, but converged as a mish-mash of distinct philosophies all vaguely oriented towards a radical end. By the mid-19th century, it became clear to all involved that the patchwork nature of the movement was untenable. Thus, the \#pink International Workingmen's Association#!, known retroactively as the \#pink First International#!, was founded as the first serious attempt to unite the various flavors of socialism around the world."
 bpm_1st_intl.1.f:0 "One element of success they possess — numbers; but numbers weigh in the balance only if united by combination and led by knowledge. Past experience has shown how disregard of that bond of brotherhood which ought to exist between the workmen of different countries, and incite them to stand firmly by each other in all their struggles for emancipation, will be chastised by the common discomfiture of their incoherent efforts.\n\n—Karl Marx, 1864"
 bpm_1st_intl.1.a:0 "Let's keep an eye on this."

 bpm_1st_intl.2.t:0 "Red and Black"
 bpm_1st_intl.2.d:0 "Hailing from a wide range of traditions, the members of the \#pink First International#! are not quite as united as some would hope. Their disagreements largely coalesce around two factions\: the @ig_anarchists! Anarchists, led chiefly by Proudhon and Bakunin, and what the anarchists refer to as @ig_socialists! Statist Socialists, including Marxists, Owenites, Blanquists, and republican nationalists of various oppressed nations. Trading fiery polemics as much as they cooperate, their disputes threaten the very existence of the coalition."
 bpm_1st_intl.2.f:0 "The International only then can become a weapon for liberating the people, when it frees itself; when it does not permit itself to be divided into two groups — a big majority, the blind tool of an educated minority. That is why its first duty is to imprint upon the minds of its members the science, philosophy, and policy of Socialism.\n\n—Mikhail Bakunin, 1869"
 bpm_1st_intl.2.a:0 "Discord among rabble rousers? Good!"

 bpm_1st_intl.2b.t:0 "Our Socialists Split!"
 bpm_1st_intl.2b.d:0 "The @ig_socialists! Socialists are no longer just a ragtag group of lofty intellectuals. Now that they have acquired a semblance of political power, their differences have also become all the more apparent, as local meetings are now dominated by debates over authoritarianism and the state. The @ig_anarchists! Anarchists have emerged as a particularly anti-authoritarian faction and are beginning to build their own organization."
 bpm_1st_intl.2b.f:0 "This revolutionary alliance excludes any idea of dictatorship and of a controlling and directive power. It is, however, necessary for the establishment of this revolutionary alliance and for the triumph of the Revolution over reaction that the unity of ideas and of revolutionary action find an organ in the midst of the popular anarchy which will be the life and the energy of the Revolution. This organ should be the secret and universal association of the International Brothers.\n\n—Mikhail Bakunin, 1869"
 bpm_1st_intl.2b.a:0 "I see."

 bpm_1st_intl.3.t:0 "The Anarchists"
 bpm_1st_intl.3.d:0 "By themselves, the @ig_anarchists! Anarchists of the early socialist movement were hardly a united front. The two main currents of anarchism were represented by Proudhon, whose mutualism promoted a society of free exchange, and Bakunin, whose collectivism pushed for the full abolition of private property.\n\nIn practice, the anarchists opposed hierarchical organization and party discipline in favor of a free and organic association, while stressing the value of direct deeds."
 bpm_1st_intl.3.f:0 "Not from the top to the bottom, by imposing a seeming unity and order on human society, as the state attempts, without regards to the differences of interest arising from differences of occupation. On the contrary, the International organizes the masses from the bottom up wards, taking the social life of the masses, their real aspirations as a starting point, and encouraging them to unite in groups according to their real interests in society.\n\n—Mikhail Bakunin, 1869"
 bpm_1st_intl.3.a:0 "And their opponents?"

 bpm_1st_intl.4.t:0 "The State Socialists"
 bpm_1st_intl.4.d:0 "The other side of the \#pink First International#! consisted of a diverse set of @ig_socialists! Socialists, pejoratively known as 'statists' by the anarchists. Unlike the anarchists, they attempted to participate in bourgeois politics in addition to economic struggles, either to achieve reforms or to advance workers' consciousness.\n\nTo the more radical members of this group, 'statist' was a misnomer. They held the abolition of the state as a long-term goal of socialism, while denouncing direct anarchism as undisciplined rhetoric."
 bpm_1st_intl.4.f:0 "One should never believe that it is of small significance to have workers in Parliament. If one stifles their voices, or if one ejects them, the reprisals and oppressions exercise a deep effect on the people. If, on the other hand, they can speak from the parliamentary tribune, as do Bebel and Liebknecht, the whole world listens to them.\n\n—Karl Marx, 1871"
 bpm_1st_intl.4.a:0 "Come and get it!"

 bpm_1st_intl.5.t:0 "An Inflection Point"
 bpm_1st_intl.5.d:0 "Amidst their many disagreements with the anarchists, the @ig_socialists! Marxists seem to have uncovered evidence of an independent anarchist 'Alliance' acting within the ranks of \#pink the International#!. Such sectarianism, they claim, threatens the integrity of \#pink the International#! and violates its founding rules. On the other hand, others believe that this is merely an excuse to sideline the @ig_anarchists! Anarchists for ideological reasons."
 bpm_1st_intl.5.f:0 "The Alliance, which considers the resurrection of the sects a great step forward, is in itself conclusive proof that their time is over\: for if initially they contained elements of progress, the program of the Alliance, in the tow of a “Mohammed without the Koran”, is nothing but a heap of pompously worded ideas long since dead and capable only of frightening bourgeois idiots or serving as evidence to be used by the Bonapartist or other prosecutors against members of the International.\n\n—Karl Marx, 1872"
 bpm_1st_intl.5.a:0 "Politics is ruthless."

 bpm_1st_intl.6.t:0 "The Resolutions"
 bpm_1st_intl.6.d:0 "The @ig_socialists! Marxists have put forth a series of resolutions to, among other things, declare the necessity of a proletarian party and expel the @ig_anarchists! Anarchists for operating a supposed secret alliance within the \#pink the International#!. Do the resolutions pass?\n\n#gold (This choice affects the willingness of @ig_anarchists! Anarchists and @ig_socialists! Socialists to cooperate internationally.)#!"
 bpm_1st_intl.6.f:0 "In its struggle against the collective power of the propertied classes, the working class cannot act as a class except by constituting itself into a political party, distinct from, and opposed to all old parties formed by the propertied classes.\n\n—Article 7a, Hague Congress, 1872"
 bpm_1st_intl.6.a:0 "The resolution passes. (Historical)"
 bpm_1st_intl.6.b:0 "The resolution fails."
