 je_bpm_central_republic_reason:0 "A year has passed since the federalist constitution of 1824 was dissolved by the triumphant conservatives. This document was replaced by the "Seven Laws" reorganizing Mexico into a unitary republic, with government power centralized in entirely in Mexico City, as well as tightening qualifications for elected office and the implementation of a fourth branch of government: The Supreme Conservative Power.\n\nWhile Intended to bring stability to the historically tumultuous nation, separatist and federalist movements threaten to disrupt the new order. If the centralist republic is to survive it must build public trust and quench the fires of rebellion."
