 bpm_russia.4.f:0 "1. All classes and class distinctions which have hitherto existed in Russia, class privileges and class limitations, class organizations and institutions, as well as all civil ranks are abolished.\n2. All estates (noble, merchant, commoner, peasant, etc.), titles (prince, count, etc.), and designations of civil ranks (privy councilor, state councilor, etc.) are abolished, and in their places the inhabitants of Russia are to have one name common to all--citizens of the Russian Republic.\n3.

All laws [relating to class institutions] are repealed.\n\n—Central Executive Committee, 1917"
 bpm_russia.4.a:0 "Another victory in the Class War!"

 bpm_russia.5.t:0 "Decree on the Abolition of Estates and Civil Ranks"
 bpm_russia.5.d:0 "As a result of our recent reforms, the instituion of a republican form of governance with universal suffrage has resulted, by necessity, in total removal of estates from [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]."
 bpm_russia.5.f:0 "1. All estate and estate distinctions which have hitherto existed in Russia, estate privileges and estate limitations, estate organizations and institutions, as well as all civil ranks are abolished.\n2. All estates (noble, merchant, commoner, peasant, etc.), titles (prince, count, etc.), and designations of civil ranks (privy councilor, state councilor, etc.) are abolished, and in their places the inhabitants of Russia are to have one name common to all--citizens of the Russian Republic."
 bpm_russia.5.a:0 "Liberty and Equality!"

 bpm_russia.6.t:0 "Abolition of Estates"
 bpm_russia.6.d:0 "The careful work done by the [ROOT.GetCountry.GetRuler.GetPrimaryRoleTitle] has finally been given a proper conclusion. With all the estates fully abolished, yet another barricade in the way of a modern and equal Russia has been removed."
 bpm_russia.6.f:0 "An interesting conundrum is filling the heads of Russian intellectuals. Russia, as it is right now, isn't truly free, and not truly a democratic republic. Yet against all odds, with no compromises, all the ancient estates were, one by one, abolished from above. It will take some time for Russians to treat each other as equals, without the estate distinction. But the first bold steps have been taken, and they can not be walked back."
 bpm_russia.6.a:0 "Let's hope we won't regret this."

 bpm_russia.7.t:0 "Twilight of Estates"
 bpm_russia.7.d:0 "As the final piece of legislation surrounding our estates goes through, we can finally say, with some compromises, that the Russian estate system is for all intents and purposes gone."
 bpm_russia.7.f:0 "Sure, the estates were not gone. The population census that the government made from time to time still questioned the people on who and what of their estates. But more and more people knew not of what estate they were in. For all intents and purposes, under the law - they were, essentially, equal. At least, as far as these ancient estates were concerned..."
 bpm_russia.7.a:0 "A Necessary Step."

 bpm_russia.10.t:0 "Krestyanin No More"
 bpm_russia.10.d:0 "With the abolition of serfdom and modernization of our statecraft and economy, the Krestyanstvo estate steps closer and closer to becoming a historic footnote. Will our current government be the one to draw this chapter to a close?"
 bpm_russia.10.f:0 "The Krestyanin is not used to good news, not from the state officials or the Dvoryanstvo. When they come, they come to take their grain, their meat, their men to die in distant wars, to accuse them of something without letting them defend themselves. But recently the news have shifted; the bad news stayed, of course, but some good news came in - corporal punishments abolished, peasants not being a property of their landowners, even some freedoms, limited as they are, were an unexpected pleasantry. And today, perhaps, will be another day on which another series of good news will reach the Russian peasant."
 bpm_russia.10.a:0 "Free the peasants from their estate"
 bpm_russia.10.b:0 "Keep the estate on the books, but abolish most related laws"
 bpm_russia.10.c:0 "We may need more time first"

 bpm_russia.11.t:0 "The Last Dvoryane"
 bpm_russia.11.d:0 "As the system of estates in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName] erodes further and further, the final estate remains to be properly abolished - the $je_bpm_russia_estates_tooltipable_nobles$. With most of Russia already free from the yoke of their own estate, however, is this final step really necessary?"
 bpm_russia.11.f:0 "For too long have the Dvoryane been a headache to everyone. To peasants who they exploited, to the city dwellers who they kept down; even to the Tsars, who had to be shackled by the short-sighted demands of the fattened nobility. Will Russia finally make the final step, to freedom from the aristocratic anchor?"
 bpm_russia.11.a:0 "We will. These outdated customs have no place in [ROOT.GetCountry.GetName]!"
 bpm_russia.11.a2:0 "We must abolish both the noble titles, and the remnants of Krestyanstvo estate."
 bpm_russia.11.b:0 "Let them keep their titles, but abolish most of the privileges"
 bpm_russia.11.c:0 "Perhaps... another time"

 bpm_russia.12.t:0 "Brought Down to Earth"
 bpm_russia.12.desc:0 "Our Dukhovenstvo enjoyed immense privilege in our country for far too long. With our new secular policy, it makes sense to rescind these now."
 bpm_russia.12.f:0 "Sure, perhaps, they will complain. To them equality with laymen or even just different clergymen feels like oppression. They will understand in time that it is necessary."
 bpm_russia.12.a:0 "Abolish the title and the privilege"
 bpm_russia.12.b:0 "The titles may stay, but not their privileges"
 bpm_russia.12.d:0 "Allow foreigners into the estate and weaken its privileges overall"
 bpm_russia.12.c:0 "We should reconsider"

 bpm_russia.13.t:0 "The City's Citizen"
 bpm_russia.13.d:0 "The various Gorozhane had plenty of laws codifying their rights and obligations, stratifying the already stratified city dwelling population. Rescinding these distinctions is necessary to abolish the estate system as a whole."
 bpm_russia.13.f:0 "The endless titles, distinctions and status symbols, giving friction to mobility of the people that will build our future. We must have this friction removed, for the sake of our future."
 bpm_russia.13.a:0 "Abolish these estates"
 bpm_russia.13.b:0 "Keep some of the estates, but abolish their related laws"
 bpm_russia.13.c:0 "Not now"

 bpm_russia.14.t:0 "The Inorodets Distinction"
 bpm_russia.14.d:0 "The so-called Inorodtsy are a legal patchwork of rules and exceptions governing their lives and our interactions with them. Simplifying and streamlining these is a necessary part of abolition of our estate system."
 bpm_russia.14.f:0 "As our estates dwindle in power, we are presented with an elephant in the room - a large group of people who were, by nature of their birth or faith, separated from the estates we have had for years, granted exceptions and special obligations. Now that the estates are gone, however, the question of the status of the Inorodetz becomes more and more pressing."
 bpm_russia.14.a:0 "Retain some native governance policies"
 bpm_russia.14.b:0 "Remove their privileges; they'll earn their rights later"
 bpm_russia.14.c:0 "We'll deal with this later"
