 bpm_misc.1.d:0 "#P As of Vic3 version 1.1.X it is recommended to use Better Politics Mod with Anbeeld's Revision of AI (ARoAI) active.#!\n\nThe strength of e.g. @ig_liberals! Liberals and @ig_socialists! Socialists are related to the progress of industrialization, so ARoAI has a significant impact on the balancing of this mod. Unfortunately, in the base game AI countries industrialize a little too slow, and with ARoAI countries industrialize a little too fast, relative to historical rates. As such, with ARoAI you will likely experience stronger than expected socialists, though this may be preferable to having weak socialists and, hence, less interesting politics."
 bpm_misc.1.f:0 "This mod is perfectly playable without ARoAI, though, in case you can't run it due to performance constraints."
 bpm_misc.1.a:0 "Okay!"
