 bpm_2nd_intl.1.t:0 "Seeds of a New International"
 bpm_2nd_intl.1.d:0 "It is generally acknowledged among @ig_socialists! Socialists that the interests of the working class transcend political borders. Since the end of the \#pink International Workingmen's Association#!, however, no serious attempts have been made at founding a new international coalition. To remedy this, delegates from various worker's organizations met today in Switzerland, where it has been decided that a new socialist manifesto should be drafted as the founding document of a \#pink Second International#!."
 bpm_2nd_intl.1.f:0 "In the proletariat of the Old World and the New, a spirit of concord prevails. Among the suffering and the oppressed there is increasing hatred of their exploiters, increasing distrust of their capitalist oppressors. Do you not feel, brothers, that this is the decisive hour?\n\n—The Brussels Congress, 1880"
 bpm_2nd_intl.1.a:0 "Let's keep an eye on this."

 bpm_2nd_intl.2.t:0 "The International and its Discontents"
 bpm_2nd_intl.2.d:0 "The convening of a \#pink Second International#! did not go as planned. Besides being poorly organized, it seems that the socialist movement is shot with divisions. Chief among these is the split between @ig_reformist_socialists! Reformists and the @ig_revolutionist_socialists! Revolutionists, who have fallen out over a practical issue — the former insist that only bona fide delegates should be able to attend the new congress, whereas the latter argue that only anonymity can ensure the safety of all participants.\n\nUnable to compromise, both camps have begun organizing separate conventions."
 bpm_2nd_intl.2.f:0 "The Congress assembled. Never in the whole history of the working class movement has a Working Men's Congress met under such humiliating conditions.\n\n—Eduard Bernstein, 1889"
 bpm_2nd_intl.2.a:0 "Discord among rabble rousers? Good!"

 bpm_2nd_intl.2b.t:0 "Our Socialists Split!"
 bpm_2nd_intl.2b.d:0 "As the @ig_socialists! Socialists grow in power, their arguments over how best to use their power grow ever heated. Their differences have finally come to a head in a recent quarrel, with one side forcibly expelling their opponents from the meeting hall. Two distinct factions emerged — the @ig_reformist_socialists! Reformists and the @ig_revolutionist_socialists! Revolutionists."
 bpm_2nd_intl.2b.f:0 "This is the nucleus of the question which causes all the differences. Is the antagonism between the middle class and the proletariat so great as to prevent the proletariat from allying itself with certain factions of the middle class against other groups of the middle class? Or are there within the middle class enmities greater than the hostility which exists between the middle class and the working class?\n\n—Karl Kautsky, 1902"
 bpm_2nd_intl.2b.a:0 "I see."

 bpm_2nd_intl.3.t:0 "The Possibilist International"
 bpm_2nd_intl.3.d:0 "Leading the @ig_reformist_socialists! Reformists are the French Possibilists and the British Trades Union Congress. Rejecting the hardline rhetoric of what they call the 'Marxist Clique', the Possibilists choose to prioritize achieving what is currently possible — incremental reforms — on the path towards attaining socialism in general. The Possibilist congress has resolved to push for, among other things, the eight-hour workday and workplace democracy."
 bpm_2nd_intl.3.f:0 "That this International Labour Congress declares that its resolutions in favour of a reduction of the hours of labour, the limitation of child labour and kindred measures, are not to be considered as expressing its full programme of Industrial Reform, but that those measures are demanded to secure the present mitigation of the hardships of labour, and to promote the leisure, education and organisation necessary to secure the ultimate ownership and control of all the means of production by the workers themselves.\n\n—The Possibilist Congress, 1889"
 bpm_2nd_intl.3.a:0 "What of the Marxists?"

 bpm_2nd_intl.4.t:0 "The Marxist International"
 bpm_2nd_intl.4.d:0 "Opposing the reformists are the @ig_revolutionist_socialists! Revolutionists, united under the banner of Marxist social democracy along with Blanquists and various other traditions. Broadly, the Marxists see agitation for reforms as a means of building revolutionary class consciousness rather than as an end in itself, prioritizing revolution as the only way to achieve socialism. They often work under illegality and, as such, accuse the Possibilists of being officially-endorsed \#gold 'Ministerial Socialists'#! opposed to the true socialist cause."
 bpm_2nd_intl.4.f:0 "Let but the Eight Hour Day alone be realised, and the first step will have been gained in the road to the final emancipation of Labour. It will be gained not perhaps so much on account of its intrinsic value, as because of the consciousness of power that it will give to workingmen when acting internationally.\n\n—Cunninghame Graham, 1889"
 bpm_2nd_intl.4.a:0 "Dangerous criminals."

 bpm_2nd_intl.5.t:0 "After the Congresses"
 bpm_2nd_intl.5.d:0 "The @ig_reformist_socialists! Reformist and @ig_revolutionist_socialists! Revolutionist congresses have concluded, and their attendees returned home to deliver the news of fiery polemics and personal attacks. The actual contents of the congresses were remarkably similar — both pushed for an eight-hour workday, both pushed for the equality of women, both were subject to infighting over unity with their wayward comrades. Nonetheless, the schism over means and ends runs deep, and the prospect of mending it seems thin."
 bpm_2nd_intl.5.f:0 "This Congress brilliantly opens up a new era of the conscious, systematic enforcement of the rights of the oppressed, planned, unanimous action by the international proletariat and socialism. It is the pledge of certain and decisive victory; long live the social international republic!\n\n—The Marxist Congress, 1889"
 bpm_2nd_intl.5.a:0 "Let's hope they stay enemies."

 bpm_2nd_intl.6.t:0 "Sera le Genre Humain?"
 bpm_2nd_intl.6.d:0 "Some time has passed since the turbulence of the opposed worker's congresses. The personal enmities stoked by the event have calmed; though both sides are once again preparing to convene their own congresses, they have sent delegates to one another in the hopes of joining in a united \#pink Second International#!.\n\nWill the comrades reunite, or will they go the way of socialists and anarchists past?\n\n#gold (This choice affects the willingness of @ig_reformist_socialists! Reformists and @ig_revolutionist_socialists! Revolutionists to cooperate internationally.)#!"
 bpm_2nd_intl.6.f:0 "Such a bridging of the chasm between the nations, such an international amalgamation of great sections of the people of different lands, the history of the world has never seen before. This phenomenon appears the more imposing when we remember that it has come into existence under the shadow of military armaments which, on their part, also offer a spectacle the like of which has never before been seen in the world.\n\n—Karl Kautsky, 1892"
 bpm_2nd_intl.6.a:0 "The two unite — for now. (Historical)"
 bpm_2nd_intl.6.b:0 "The two remain separate."

 bpm_2nd_intl.7.t:0 "A Symbolic Vote"
 bpm_2nd_intl.7.d:0 "The drama of the \#pink Second International#! has widened the divisions between socialists in our own country. At a recent party meeting, their infighting came to an inflection point. One faction proposed a new set of membership rules, while the other threatened a boycott if the proposal passes.\n\nHow did the vote turn out?\n\n#gold (This affects the willingness of our @ig_reformist_socialists! Reformists and @ig_revolutionist_socialists! Revolutionists to work in the same party.)#!"
 bpm_2nd_intl.7.f:0 "To try to prove that the central bodies are 'ineffectual' by boycotting them is an unprecedented and unparalleled violation of Party duty, and no sophistry can conceal the fact — the boycott is a step towards disrupting the Party. The Russian Social-Democratic movement is in the throes of the last difficult transition from the circles to a Party, from philistinism to a realisation of revolutionary duty, from acting by means of scandal-mongering and circle pressure to discipline.\n\n—Vladimir Lenin, 1903"
 bpm_2nd_intl.7.a:0 "The two factions found a compromise."
 bpm_2nd_intl.7.b:0 "The dissenting faction got kicked out."

 bpm_1st_commie_rev.2.t:0 "The Crisis of Social Democracy"
 bpm_1st_commie_rev.2.d:0 "#pink The first spark of socialist world-revolution has arrived in [SCOPE.sCountry('first_major_rev_country_scope').GetName]!#!\n\nWorkers around the world are celebrating in the streets, though not all socialists are entirely happy. Some say that the situation is not yet ripe, while others condemn the authoritarian practices of the new revolutionary government. These debates have heightened preexisting disputes into a life-or-death struggle; if the @ig_reformist_socialists! Reformists and @ig_revolutionist_socialists! Revolutionists had any possibility of working together before, they certainly do not now."
 bpm_1st_commie_rev.2.f:0 "This party which in peace-time pretended to march at the head of the world proletariat, which presumed to advise and lead the whole world, which in its own country counted at least ten million supporters of both sexes — this is the party which has nailed socialism to the cross twenty-four hours a day for the four years at the bidding of the ruling class like venal mercenaries of the Middle Ages.\n\n—Rosa Luxemburg, 1918"
 bpm_1st_commie_rev.2.a:0 "A sign of things to come."

 bpm_1st_commie_rev.3.t:0 "Reviving the Spectre"
 bpm_1st_commie_rev.3.d:0 "Fed up with the inaction of their former comrades, the radicals of the social democratic movement have begun to call themselves @ig_revolutionist_socialists! Communists. Their moderate cousins, meanwhile, have abandoned all revolutionary rhetoric while retaining the old label of @ig_reformist_socialists! Social Democracy."
 bpm_1st_commie_rev.3.f:0 "And our Party, which at the present time undoubtedly enjoys the greatest sympathy of the masses of the working people of all countries — our Party must make the most decisive, sharp, clear and unambiguous statement that is possible to the effect that it has broken off connections with that old official socialism, for which purpose a change in the name of the Party will be the most effective means.\n\n—Vladimir Lenin, 1918"
 bpm_1st_commie_rev.3.a:0 "The spectre never left."
