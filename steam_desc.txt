[h2]New Update: BPM 2.4! [/h2]
Introducing our new movement system!
[list]
[*] Movements now can cause IGs to split, and form new IGs.
[*] Movement can influence IG's ideology into supporting their beliefs.
[*] Movements will pressure and scare IGs into supporting law votes.
[*] Movement attraction has been reworked to take into account new values: Labor Consciousness and Liberal Consciousness
[list]
    [*]The higher these values are the more pops will support movements of their corresponding types. Different pop types are impacted differently by these values.
[/list]

[h3]The 2.4 update is incompatible with 2.3 saves. If you would like to continue a BPM 2.3 game, download the old version from Github here: [/h3]

[h3]For a version of BPM without the new Interest Groups, you can get BPM Lite here:[/h3]

(BPM Lite is [i]not[/i] the intended experience! If you are a new player, please try the full version first)

The goal of BPM is to make politics [b]more dynamic[/b], [b]more legible[/b], [b]more materialist[/b], and [b]more historically accurate[/b]. Specifically, it sets out to correct these problems we have with the base game:
[olist]
[*]Seven interest groups are not nearly sufficient to represent the breadth of political history. 
[*]The ideology of an IG leader has too large and random an effect on politics. For instance, trade unions can swing from communist to reactionary overnight.
[*]All IGs are internally united, when many of them suffered infighting and splits IRL. Why should all urban workers become communist at the same time? Where did the moderates go?
[*]Political parties are shallow. They're too arbitrary, form and dissipate too frequently. Coalitions are either small and boring or huge and illegitimate.
[*]There is little international interaction between IGs, when many of them communicated and collaborated actively.
[/olist]

[h3]Features include, but are not limited to:[/h3]
[list]
[*]New Ideological IGs: Liberals, Radical Liberals, Conservatives, Reactionaries, Agrarian Populists, Trade Unionists, Socialists, Anarchists, Reformist Socialists, Revolutionist Socialists, Market Liberals, National Liberals
[*]Vanilla IGs are reskinned and tweaked to represent various 'Interests.'
[*]IG splits: Socialists vs Anarchists, Reformist vs Revolutionary Socialists, Liberals vs Market Liberals vs National Liberals
[*]Overhauled law enactment & sway mechanics
[*]Political Rigidity mechanic
[*]Repeatable Laws
[*]New Journal Entries and Event chains
[*]New Laws and Institutions
[*]Tons of unique flavor

[h3]Compatibility:[/h3]
For all mods listed below, [b]make sure BPM is placed last in the load order[/b].
[list]
[*][b]Victorian Tweaks Mod[/b] (VTM): Mostly compatible, with a minor election momentum bug. May have balance issues.
[*][b]Ultra Historical[/b] (UH): Politics mod is incompatible. Research and Education requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3119667295&searchtext=Better+Politics+Mod+compatibility]this compatch[/url]. All others are compatible.
[*][b]Victorian Flavor Mod[/b] (VFM): Requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3129726814]this compatch[/url].
[*][b]The Great Rework[/b] (TGR): Incompatible, but integration is coming.
[*][b]Divergences[/b]: [b]NO LONGER[/b] compatible after their recent update. [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3131712992&searchtext=BPM+Divergences]Compatch here is for the old version.[/url] Use at your own risk!
[*][b]Industry Expanded[/b]: Requires [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3138186286]this compatch[/url].
[*]Otherwise, BPM should be compatible with most mods that do not add new laws, ideologies, or institutions.
[*]Mods that add new pop types and IGs should work, but no guarantees that they interact with BPM in ways that make sense.
